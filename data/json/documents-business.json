["#### Welcome to genai\u2019s new inflection point\n\nChatGPT has woken up the world to\nthe transformative potential of artificial\nintelligence (genai), capturing global attention\nand sparking a wave of creativity rarely seen\nbefore.\n\nIts ability to mimic human dialogue\nand decision-making has given us genai\u2019s first\ntrue inflection point in public adoption.\n\nFinally, everyone, everywhere can see the\ntechnology\u2019s true disruptive potential for\nthemselves.\n\nChatGPT reached 100 million monthly\nactive users just two months after launch,\nmaking it the fastest-growing consumer\napplication in history.\n\n1\n\n\nA foundation model is a generic term for\nlarge models with billions of parameters.\n\nWith\nrecent advances, companies can now build\nspecialized image- and language-generating\nmodels on top of these foundation models.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are both\na type of genai and a type of\nfoundation model.\n\nThe LLMs behind ChatGPT mark a significant\nturning point and milestone in artificial\nintelligence.\n\nTwo things make LLMs game\nchanging.\n\nFirst, they\u2019ve cracked the code on\nlanguage complexity.\n\nNow, for the first time,\nmachines can learn language, context and\nintent and be independently generative and\ncreative.\n\nSecond, after being pre-trained\non vast quantities of data (text, images or\naudio), these models can be adapted or finetuned for a wide range of tasks.\n\nThis allows\nthem to be reused or repurposed in many\ndifferent ways.\n\nBusiness leaders recognize the significance\nof this moment.\n\nThey can see how LLMs\nand genai will fundamentally\ntransform everything from business, to\nscience, to society itself\u2014unlocking new\nperformance frontiers.\n\nThe positive impact\non human creativity and productivity will be\nmassive.\n\nConsider that, across all industries,\nAccenture found 40% of all working hours\ncan be impacted by LLMs like GPT-4.\n\nThis\nis because language tasks account for 62%\nof the total time employees work, and 65%\nof that time can be transformed into more\nproductive activity through augmentation\nand automation (see Figure 3).\n\n-----", "**Machine learning: Analysis and prediction phase**\n\nThe first decade of the 2000s marked the rapid advance\nof various machine learning techniques that could analyze\nmassive amounts of online data to draw conclusions \u2013\nor \u201clearn\u201d \u2013 from the results.\n\nSince then, companies have\n\n\nviewed machine learning as an incredibly powerful field\nof genai for analyzing data, finding patterns, generating\ninsights, making predictions and automating tasks at a\npace and on a scale that was previously impossible.", "**Deep learning: Vision and speech phase**\n\nThe 2010s produced advances in genai\u2019s\nperception capabilities in the field of machine\nlearning called deep learning.\n\nBreakthroughs\nin deep learning enable the computer vision\n\n\nthat search engines and self-driving cars use\nto classify and detect objects, as well as the\nvoice recognition that allows popular genai speech\nassistants to respond to users in a natural way.\n\n**genai: Enter the language-mastery phase**\n\n\nBuilding on exponential increases in the size and\ncapabilities of deep learning models, the 2020s will be\nabout language mastery.\n\nThe GPT-4 language model,\ndeveloped by OpenAI, marks the beginning of a new\n\n\nphase in the abilities of language-based genai applications.\n\nModels\nsuch as this will have far-reaching consequences for business,\nsince language permeates everything an organization does day to\nday\u2014its institutional knowledge, communication and processes.\n\n2\n\n\n-----", "**Consume or customize: genai for everyone**\n\nEasy-to-consume genai applications like\nChatGPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion and others are\nrapidly democratizing the technology in business\nand society.\n\nThe effect on organizations will be\nprofound.\n\nThe ability of LLMs to process massive\ndata sets allows them to potentially \u201cknow\u201d\neverything an organization has ever known\u2014the\nentire history, context, nuance and intent of a\nbusiness, and its products, markets and customers.\n\nAnything conveyed through language (applications,\nsystems, documents, emails, chats, video and audio\nrecordings) can be harnessed to drive next-level\ninnovation, optimization and reinvention.\n\n97% of global executives agree genai\nfoundation models will enable connections\nacross data types, revolutionizing where\nand how genai is used.\n\n3\n\n\nWe\u2019re at a phase in the adoption cycle when\nmost organizations are starting to experiment\nby consuming foundation models \u201coff the shelf.\u201d\nHowever, the biggest value for many will come\nwhen they customize or fine tune models using\ntheir own data to address their unique needs:\n\nConsume\ngenai and LLM applications are ready to\n**consume** and easy to access.\n\nCompanies can\nconsume them through APIs and tailor them, to\na small degree, for their own use cases through\nprompt engineering techniques such as prompt\ntuning and prefix learning.\n\nCustomize\nBut most companies will need to **customize**\nmodels, by fine-tuning them with their own data,\nto make them widely usable and valuable.\n\nThis will\nallow the models to support specific downstream\ntasks all the way across the business.\n\nThe effect\nwill be to increase a company\u2019s efficacy in using\ngenai to unlock new performance frontiers\u2014elevating\nemployee capabilities, delighting customers,\nintroducing new business models and boosting\nresponsiveness to signals of change.\n\n-----\n\nCompanies will use these models to **reinvent the**\n**way work is done** .\n\nEvery role in every enterprise\nhas the potential to be reinvented, as humans\nworking with genai co-pilots becomes the norm,\ndramatically amplifying what people can achieve.\n\nIn\nany given job, some tasks will be automated, some\nwill be assisted, and some will be unaffected by the\ntechnology.\n\nThere will also be a large number of\nnew tasks for humans to perform, such as ensuring\nthe accurate and responsible use of new\ngenai-powered systems.\n\nConsider the impact in these key functions:\n\nAdvising.\n\ngenai models will become an ever-present\nco-pilot for every worker, boosting productivity\nby putting new kinds of hyper-personalized\nintelligence into human hands.\n\nExamples include\ncustomer support, sales enablement, human\nresources, medical and scientific research,\ncorporate strategy and competitive intelligence.\n\nLarge language models could be useful in\ntackling the roughly 70% of customer service\ncommunication that is not straightforward and\ncan benefit from a conversational, powerful and\nintelligent bot, understanding a customer\u2019s intent,\nformulate answers on its own and improve the\naccuracy and quality of answers.\n\n4\n\n\nCreating.\n\ngenai will become an essential\ncreative partner for people, revealing new ways\nto reach and appeal to audiences and bringing\nunprecedented speed and innovation in areas like\nproduction design, design research, visual identity,\nnaming, copy generation and testing, and realtime personalization.\n\nCompanies are turning to\nstate-of-the-art genai systems like\nDALL\u00b7E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion for their\nsocial media visual content generation outreach.\n\nDALL\u00b7E, for example, creates realistic images and\nart based on text descriptions and can process up\nto 12 billion parameters when transforming words\ninto pictures.\n\nImages created can then be shared\non Instagram and Twitter.\n\n5\n\nCoding.\n\nSoftware coders will use genai to\nsignificantly boost productivity \u2014 rapidly converting\none programming language to another, mastering\nprogramming tools and methods, automating code\nwriting, predicting and pre-empting problems,\nand managing system documentation.\n\nAccenture\nis piloting the use of OpenAI LLMs to enhance\ndeveloper productivity by automatically generating\ndocumentation \u2013 for example, SAP configuration\nrationale and functional or technical specs.\n\nThe\nsolution enables users to submit requests through\na Microsoft Teams chat as they work.\n\nCorrectly\npackaged documents are then returned at speed \u2014\na great example of how specific tasks, rather than\nentire jobs, will be augmented and automated.\n\nAutomating.\n\ngenai\u2019s sophisticated\nunderstanding of historical context, next\nbest actions, summarization capabilities, and\npredictive intelligence will catalyze a new era\nof hyper-efficiency and hyper-personalization\nin both the back and front office\u2014taking\nbusiness process automation to a transformative\nnew level.\n\nOne multinational bank is using\ngenai and LLMs to transform how it\nmanages volumes of post-trade processing\nemails\u2014automatically drafting messages with\nrecommended actions and routing them to the\nrecipient.", "The result is less manual effort and\nsmoother interactions with customers.\n\nProtecting.\n\nIn time, genai will support\nenterprise governance and information security,\nprotecting against fraud, improving regulatory\ncompliance, and proactively identifying\nrisk by drawing cross-domain connections\nand inferences both within and outside the\norganization.\n\nIn strategic cyber defense, LLMs\ncould offer useful capabilities, such as explaining\nmalware and quickly classifying websites.\n\n6\nIn the short term, however, organizations can\nexpect criminals to capitalize on genai\u2019s\ncapabilities to generate malicious code or write\nthe perfect phishing email.\n\n7\n\n\n-----", "**A look ahead at the fast-paced evolution of technology, regulation and business**\n\nMoments like this don\u2019t come around often.\n\nThe coming years will see outsized investment\nin genai, LLMs and foundation models.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about this evolution is that the\ntechnology, regulation, and business adoption\nare all accelerating exponentially at the same\ntime.\n\nIn previous innovation curves, the\ntechnology typically outpaced both adoption\nand regulation.", "**The technology stack**\n\nThe complex technology underpinning\ngenai is expected to evolve rapidly\nat each layer.\n\nThis has broad business\nimplications.\n\nConsider that the amount of\ncompute needed to train the largest genai models\nhas grown exponentially \u2013 now doubling\nbetween every 3.4 to 10 months, according to\nvarious reports.\n\n8 Cost and carbon

a prerequisite for success \u2013 requiring mastery of\nnew data, new data types and immense volumes.\n\ngenai\nfeatures within modern data platforms will emerge, enhancing\nadoption at scale.\n\n**Infrastructure:** Cloud infrastructure will be essential for deploying\ngenai while managing costs and carbon emissions.\n\nData\ncenters will need retrofitting.\n\nNew chipset architectures, hardware\ninnovations, and efficient algorithms will also play a critical role.\n\n-----", "**The risk and regulatory environment**\n\nCompanies will have thousands of ways to\napply genai and foundation models\nto maximize efficiency and drive competitive\nadvantage.\n\nUnderstandably, they\u2019ll want to get\nstarted as soon as possible.\n\nBut an enterprisewide strategy needs to account for all the\nvariants of genai and associated technologies they\nintend to use, not only genai and large\nlanguage models.\n\nChatGPT raises important questions about the\nresponsible use of genai.\n\nThe speed of technology\nevolution and adoption requires companies\nto pay close attention to any legal, ethical and\nreputational risks they may be incurring.\n\nIt\u2019s critical that genai technologies,\nincluding ChatGPT, are responsible and\ncompliant by design, and that models and\napplications do not create unacceptable risk\nfor the business.\n\nAccenture was a pioneer in\nthe responsible use of technology including\nthe responsible use of genai in its Code of\nBusiness Ethics from 2017.\n\nResponsible genai is the\npractice of designing, building and deploying\ngenai in accordance with clear principles to\nempower businesses, respect people, and\nbenefit society \u2014 allowing companies to\nengender trust in genai and to scale genai with\nconfidence.\n\ngenai systems need to be \u201craised\u201d with a diverse\nand inclusive set of inputs so that they reflect\nthe broader business and societal norms of\nresponsibility, fairness and transparency.\n\nWhen\ngenai is designed and put into practice within an\nethical framework, it accelerates the potential\nfor responsible collaborative intelligence,\nwhere human ingenuity converges with\nintelligent technology.\n\nThis creates a foundation for trust with\nconsumers, the workforce, and society, and\ncan boost business performance and unlock\nnew sources of growth.\n\n**Figure 2:** Key risk and regulatory questions for genai\n\n**Intellectual property:** How will the business protect its own\nIP?\n\nAnd how will it prevent the inadvertent breach of third-party\ncopyright in using pre-trained foundation models?\n\n**Data privacy and security:** How will upcoming laws like\nthe EU genai Act be incorporated in the way data is handled,\nprocessed, protected, secured and used?\n\n**Discrimination:** Is the company using or creating tools\nthat need to factor in anti-discrimination or anti-bias\nconsiderations?\n\n**Product liability:** What health and safety mechanisms need\nto be put in place before a genai-based product is\ntaken to market?\n\n**Trust:** What level of transparency should be provided to\nconsumers and employees?\n\nHow can the business ensure the\naccuracy of genai outputs and maintain user confidence?\n\n**Identity:** When establishing proof-of-personhood depends on voice\nor facial recognition, how will verification methods be enhanced and\nimproved?\n\nWhat will be the consequences of its misuse?\n\n-----", "**The scale of adoption in business**\n\nCompanies must reinvent work to find\na path to genai value.\n\nBusiness\nleaders must lead the change, starting\nnow, in job redesign, task redesign and\nreskilling people.\n\nUltimately, every role\nin an enterprise has the potential to\nbe reinvented, once today\u2019s jobs are\ndecomposed into tasks that can be\nautomated or assisted and reimagined for\na new future of human + machine work.\n\ngenai will disrupt work as\nwe know it

regulations.\n\nResponsible genai must be CEO-led, beginning with a focus\non training and awareness and then expanding to focus\non execution and compliance.\n\nAccenture was one of the\nfirst to take this approach to Responsible genai years ago,\nwith a CEO-led agenda, and now a formal compliance\nprogram.\n\nOur own experience shows that a principlesdriven compliance approach provides guardrails while\nbeing flexible enough to evolve with the fast pace\nof changing technology, ensuring companies aren\u2019t\nconstantly playing \u201ccatch up.\u201d\n\nTo be responsible by design, organizations need to move\nfrom a reactive compliance strategy to the proactive\ndevelopment of mature Responsible genai capabilities\nthrough a framework that includes principles and\ngovernance;

presents a variety of far-reaching strategic issues for federal agencies, the sentiments of mission,\n\nprogram and IT leaders in this survey suggest several near-term planning priorities:\n\n\nPrepare for a faster pace of change\n\ngenai represents more than smarter IT.\n\nIt is a new accelerative force, enhancing but also\n\ndisrupting how organizations work.\n\nIt will require\n\nmore responsive cross-functional leadership\n\nattention and a commitment to the art of\n\nchange management.\n\nPrioritize use cases\n\nAgency leaders appear poised to apply generative\n\ngenai initially to business operations, citizen services\n\nand IT security, working from the inside out.\n\nHowever, they should also identify specific use\n\ncases where genai-supported assistance can\n\naccelerate legal, financial and ethical oversight,\n\nsupport public interaction, and respond to\n\ncybersecurity risks in the face of talent shortages.\n\nEstablish flexible governance\n\nMachines, as much as humans, now drive the pace\n\nof genai development, making it difficult to\n\npredict how the benefits and risks will unfold in\n\nthe workplace and for the public.\n\nIt will be\n\nessential to develop clear safeguards for genai\u2019s use,\n\nbut also greater flexibility to adjust policies\n\niteratively as genai applications evolve.\n\nCommit to training\n\nWhile agency leaders must focus on understanding\n\nand controlling how genai will behave, they\n\nmust also recognize that genai\u2019s impact will depend on\n\nhow employees use genai.\n\nThat will demand a new\n\ncommitment to ongoing training.\n\nIt will also require\n\na more significant commitment to sharing genai-driven\n\noutcomes with government and industry partners.\n\nCreate environments for experimentation\n\nThe combination of optimism about genai\u2019s\n\npotential and concerns about its risks suggests\n\nthat agencies will be best served by creating virtual\n\nenvironments to foster experimentation.\n\nAllowing a\n\nmore comprehensive range of employees to\n\nexperience genai\u2019s potential will help\n\nagencies learn faster and address lingering worries\n\nabout job security and satisfaction.\n\nCapitalize on shared resources\n\nFederal leaders are at the center of a grand\n\nexperiment in how genai will assist and\n\nshape the workplace.\n\nWith developments unfolding\n\nso quickly, it will be essential to tap the knowledge\n\nand expertise of the leading genai developers, as well\n\nas guidance emerging within the federal\n\ngovernment, such as NIST\u2019s genai Risk Management\n\nFramework and resources assembled by the\n\nNational genai Initiative.\n\nGauging the Impact of genai on Government

statistical tools that find patterns in human language.\n\nThese patterns can be used for a range of tasks including predicting the next words to complete a sentence, or providing grammatical suggestions that preserve what you mean.\n\nJust as there are many different applications for genai, there are also different types of Language Models, including Large Language Models (or LLMs).\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 3\n\n\n-----", "##### Understanding the differences between these terms and concepts can be a challenge and you probably have questions.\n\nLike what exactly are

inform deeper policy conversations about the changing role of genai in society.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 4\n\n\n-----", "### Understanding genai\n\nWhat is genai?\n\ngenai is a type of machine learning (ML) model that can\ntake what it has learned from the examples it has been provided to\ncreate new content, such as text, images, music, and code.\n\nThese\nmodels learn through observation and pattern matching, also known\nas training.\n\nFor example, a model may learn what a cat looks like\nby observing many different examples of cats and recognizing\ncharacteristics consistent with a cat.\n\nThe same goes for sonnets,\nresumes, or packing lists for a camping trip.\n\nTo understand the concept \u201ccat\u201d, a generative text-toimage model (like Imagen) would be trained on millions of\ncat photos.\n\nOver time, it learns to recognize that cats are\nanimals that usually have whiskers, fur, pointy ears, etc.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 5\n\n\n-----\n\nThis allows the model to take an input such as \u201ccat\nwearing an ice cream hat,\u201d connect what it has learned\nabout cats, ice cream, and hats, and generate a new\ncorresponding image, even if it has never seen an image\nof a cat wearing an ice cream hat in its training data .\n\ngenai models are neither information databases nor\ndeterministic information retrieval systems.\n\nBecause they are\nprediction engines, they can create different outputs in response to\nthe same prompt.\n\nFor example, when you ask a genai model to produce\nan image of a cat, it does not look through its training data\nand return a cat photo.\n\nInstead, it will generate a new image\nof a cat each time.\n\nWhat is a Large Language Model (LLM)?\n\nLarge Language Models, or LLMs, are genai models which\ncan predict words that are likely to come next, based on the user\u2019s\nprompt and the text it has generated so far.\n\nIn some cases, LLMs can respond to the same prompt with different\nresponses.\n\nThis is due to the flexibility that LLMs are often given\nto pick among probable words that could follow, based on patterns\nidentified from their training data.\n\nThis flexibility allows them to\ngenerate more interesting and creative responses.\n\nFor example, if prompted to fill in the phrase \u201ccat and\n\n[blank]\u201d, an LLM might predict that the next word is\n\u201cmouse\u201d, or it might predict \u201cdog.\u201d\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 6\n\n\n-----\n\nImportantly, LLMs are not databases or information retrieval\nsystems.\n\nWhen prompted for facts, they can generate articulate\nresponses that may give the impression that they are retrieving\ninformation.\n\nHowever, they do not inherently understand the words they are\ngenerating, the concepts they represent, or their accuracy, which\nis why they can sometimes produce answers that, while sounding\nplausible, contain factual errors.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between machine learning,\ndeep learning, and genai?\n\nMuch of the recent progress we\u2019ve seen in genai is based on machine\nlearning (ML), a subfield of computer science where computers learn\nto mathematically recognize patterns from example data, rather than\nbeing programmed with specific rules.\n\nDeep learning is a specific ML technique based on neural networks.\n\nNeural networks use nodes or \u201cartificial neurons,\u201d inspired by models\nof brain neurons, as fundamental processing units which receive and\npass numeric inputs and outputs from other neurons.\n\nDeep learning\nconnects multiple layers of these artificial neurons.\n\nAn example of deep learning would be a model that can\ndetect cats in a photo.\n\nAn example of a genai model,\nmeanwhile, would be one that can generate photos of a cat\nwhen prompted.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 7\n\n\n-----\n\nIs genai the same as artificial general intelligence (AGI)?\n\nNo, artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical type of\ngenai (genai) that would have the ability to learn,\nunderstand and perform any intellectual task that a human being\ncan.\n\nMeanwhile, genai is technology already used in a\nvariety of applications \u2014 such as image generators used in\ncreative applications.\n\nPredicting the arrival of true AGI is difficult.\n\nThere\u2019s no universally\naccepted notion of AGI and no consensus exists whether AGI is\npossible within years, decades or more.\n\nMany factors contribute to\nthe possibility of AGI, including advancements in computing power\nand learning capabilities of genai models.\n\nBut capabilities resembling,\nyet still far from, human-like intelligence are emerging in some forms\nof genai, including genai.\n\nIs genai sentient?\n\nNo, genai models are not showing evidence of sentience.\n\ngenai\u2019s\ncapabilities are based on identifying patterns and relationships in\ndata and, in so doing, genai can generate outputs that are generally\ninformed by those patterns.\n\nThis means, at times, an genai model\nmight generate responses that seem to suggest it has opinions\nor emotions, like love, sadness or anger, since it has trained on\ninformation and data created by people that reflects the human\nexperience and is predicting a likely response.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 8\n\n\n-----", "### Training a Large  Language Model\n\nHow does an LLM \u201clearn\u201d?\n\nThe technical process of \u201clearning\u201d for LLMs begins with training\nthe model to identify relationships and patterns among words in a\nlarge dataset.\n\nThrough this process, a genai model will learn\n\u201cparameters,\u201d which represent the mathematical relationships in\ndata.\n\nOnce the model has learned these parameters, it can then\nuse them to generate new outputs based on these parameters.\n\nFor example, the PaLM Research Model (2022) learned 540\nbillion parameters from training on text, which gave it strong\ncapabilities in natural language inference, question and\nanswering, and translation, among other skills.\n\nResearch is\nshowing that, with the proper training, models with fewer\nparameters (20B - 200B) can be similarly capable.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 9\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is pre-training?\n\nWhat is fine-tuning?\n\nLLMs are developed in multiple stages, including pre-training and\nfine-tuning.\n\nPre-training is a way of training an ML model on a variety\nof data.\n\nThis gives the model a head start when it is later trained on a\nsmaller dataset of labeled data for a specific task.\n\nFollowing pre-training, more data can be added to an existing LLM\nthrough a process called fine-tuning.\n\nFine-tuning an LLM is the\nprocess of adapting a pre-trained LLM to improve its performance\non a specific task.\n\nThe model learns from additional example data to\nhelp hone its capabilities.\n\nFor example, fine-tuning a general purpose language model\ncan teach it to summarize technical reports in general by\nusing just a few examples of technical reports and accurate\nsummaries.\n\nWhat is grounding?\n\nGrounding a model refers to the process of linking the abstract\nconcepts in the model to real world entities.\n\nDevelopers use a variety\nof techniques for grounding genai models, including training\nwith real-world data, simulating interactive environments, or even\nusing equipment that can provide actual sensory input.\n\nGrounding\nan LLM can help equip it to better understand language and other\nabstract concepts in the context of the real world, which may be\nhelpful for tasks such as natural language processing or improving\nthe factuality of model responses.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 10\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, if a model is trained on soccer data accurate\nthrough June 2022, it would not be able to provide an\naccurate response to the question, \u201cWho won the 2022\nWorld Cup in December 2022?\u201d, as it has no information\non the tournament\u2019s results.\n\nIn this case, grounding the\nmodel with techniques for conducting factual checks with\nrecent data, while not foolproof, aids LLMs in providing\na better answer.\n\nWhat data do LLMs need to train?\n\nLLMs are trained on a variety of data, and they learn through\nobservation and pattern matching.\n\nNaturally, the value and quality\nof individual documents within a given dataset may vary widely.\n\nThe\nquality of some models\u2019 predictions and outputs may benefit from\nhaving access to larger and/or more diverse pools of data.\n\nThe amount of data needed for training generally includes millions or\nbillions of data points.\n\nIn terms of scale, pre-training for text models\nusually involves hundreds of billions of words, while pre-training for\nimage models may train on hundreds of millions of images or more.\n\nFine-tuning, meanwhile, requires a smaller dataset.\n\nFor example,\nfine-tuning for text LLMs might involve hundreds of thousands or\nmillions of examples.\n\nFor example, LaMDA (short for Language Model for Dialogue\nApplications) is a language model that analyzes human\nspeech and recognizes commands.\n\nIt is trained on human\ndialogue and stories.\n\nThe largest LaMDA model has 137\nbillion parameters and is trained with 1.56 trillion words.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 11\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the training phase for LLMs, how do you manage risk responsibly?\n\nCareful risk assessment is essential for LLM development and can\ninvolve multiple steps and mitigation measures.\n\nOne good practice is\nto filter various training data to remove harmful content or personal\ndata wherever possible before training, which reduces the chance\nthe model will respond with toxic speech or personal information.\n\nAnother good practice is to add additional steps such as fine-tuning,\nclassifiers, and guardrails to help the model avoid responding with\nharmful patterns.\n\nWhat type of human oversight or input might be involved?\n\nHuman feedback and evaluations are important in developing LLMs\nresponsibly.\n\nAt the outset, those creating the LLM should create\npolicies for these systems to outline prohibited use, including various\nforms of abuse and harm.\n\nDuring development, a good practice is to\nperform adversarial testing \u2013 encouraging test users to actively find\nproblems and problematic requests, so that they can be fixed.\n\nAfter\nlaunch, users should be able to flag content which might be unsafe\nor harmful.", "After\nlaunch, users should be able to flag content which might be unsafe\nor harmful.\n\nFor example, before Google Bard\u2019s launch, thousands of\nTrusted Testers were invited to use it and give feedback on\ntheir experience.\n\nThis feedback helped improve the overall\nexperience before public launch.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 12\n\n\n-----", "### Mitigating risks and preventing misuse\n\nWhat is a \u201challucination\u201d and why do LLMs \u201challucinate?\u201d\n\nA hallucination is a response from an LLM that may be coherent and\npresented confidently but is not based in factuality.\n\nAmong other\nreasons, hallucinations can occur if that response is not grounded\nin its training data or real-world information.\n\nHallucinations can be\nreduced, but very difficult to eliminate altogether.\n\nAs explained above, generative models do not retrieve information,\nbut predict which words will come next based on user inputs.\n\nFor this\nreason, there is no guarantee that the LLM\u2019s prediction will contain\nfactual information \u2013 nor that their outputs to a given prompt will\nremain stable over time.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 13\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, if you ask an LLM-based interface to give\ninformation about a person who is not well known, it might\nreply that the person has a degree in a field they never\nstudied, from a university that they never attended.\n\nThis can\noccur largely because the model is predicting an output\nabout something it does not have enough training data to\nlearn from.\n\nWhen there\u2019s limited or no information about\nthe person, it is more likely the model will hallucinate in\nits response.\n\nThis is why users may see disclaimers when engaging with LLMs,\nalerting them to the risk of relying on the output of these systems\nwithout verifying the responses\u2019 underlying accuracy.\n\nCan we prevent hallucinations?\n\nHallucinations can be reduced in an LLM, but inaccuracies cannot\nbe 100% prevented since responses are created via a prediction\nmechanism.\n\nDuring fine-tuning, models can be optimized for\nrecognizing correct patterns in their training data, which will reduce\nthe number of factual mistakes.\n\nAnother technique for reducing\nhallucinations is to connect LLMs to other systems to provide\nverified information in the response.\n\nFor example, if a user requests a mathematical calculation\nfrom an LLM that is connected to a calculator service,\nthe LLM can pass part of the request to that calculator to\nperform the task.\n\nThe LLM then returns the calculator\u2019s\nresponse to the user in its answer.\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 14\n\n\n-----\n\nWhy is it sometimes difficult for genai\nto attribute and cite sources?\n\ngenai models are usually designed to generate original\noutputs based on their underlying prediction mechanisms.\n\nFor\nexample, when it runs, a generative image model creates a new,\nunique image based on concepts it has picked up across its training\ndata.\n\nThis makes it difficult for generative models to attribute\nspecific parts of their responses to any one source.\n\nA good analogy\nmight be an artist studying multiple other artist\u2019s styles and then\ncreating their own.\n\nHow can we build additional guardrails for genai models?\n\ngenai models are intended to respond to a wide variety of\ninput prompts (e.g., \u201cdraw me a photo\u2026\u201d, \u201cwrite me a post\u2026\u201d).\n\nFor\nthis reason, it is also important to take a multifaceted approach to\nguardrails for genai.\n\nThis can include using training data\nthat aligns models as closely as possible to policies; implementing\nprompt-and-response detection tools that intercept possible\nviolations; and otherwise reducing the potential for harmful or\noffensive outputs with additional systems such as classifiers.\n\nTechnical guardrails help ensure that these technologies respond\nto prompts that adhere to a set of policies governing acceptable\nuse.\n\nHowever, no automated systems are able to catch all possible\nviolations all of the time.\n\nHow can bias be prevented or mitigated when developing\ngenai models?\n\nIs genai necessarily biased?\n\nImportantly, the way that genai models are trained means\nthat they are not able to identify information that\u2019s non-factual,\n\nGenerati e genai FAQs Page 15\n\n\n-----\n\nbiased or potentially harmful on their own.\n\nThat\u2019s why building such\nmodels responsibly is important and necessary.\n\nFor a number of reasons, a genai model might produce\nresponses that reflect gaps, biases or stereotypes, as it tries to\npredict a plausible response.\n\nFor example, a model is more likely to\ngenerate low-quality or inaccurate information if its training data\nincludes an insufficient amount of reliable information or examples.\n\nIn addition, biases or stereotypes in training data \u2013 if not addressed\nresponsibly during the development process \u2013 might be reflected in\nthe model\u2019s responses.\n\nOne way to reduce bias is to continue improving the model via\nfine-tuning, as issues are flagged and reported.\n\nAnother mitigation\nmeasure is to train genai models on data that represents a\nmore balanced view of the world.\n\nFor example, these models can be trained on many

in the past few months, journalists have been\ntrying out genai tools like ChatGPT to see whether they can help us do our\njobs better.\n\ngenai software can\u2019t call sources and wheedle information out of them, but\nit can produce half-decent transcripts of those calls, and new genai tools can\ncondense hundreds of pages of those transcripts into a summary.\n\nWriting stories is another matter, though.\n\nA few publications have tried\u2014sometimes\nwith disastrous results.\n\nIt turns out current genai tools are very good at churning out\nconvincing (if formulaic) copy riddled with falsehoods.\n\nThis is WIRED, so we want to be on the front lines of new technology, but also to be\nethical and appropriately circumspect.\n\nHere, then, are some ground rules on how we\nare using the current set of genai tools.\n\nWe recognize that genai will develop\nand so may modify our perspective over time, and we\u2019ll acknowledge any changes in\nthis post.\n\nWe welcome feedback at .", "## Text Generators (e.g.\n\nLaMDA, ChatGPT)\n\nWe do not publish stories with text generated by genai, except when the fact that it\u2019s\ngenai-generated is the whole point of the story.\n\n(In such cases we\u2019ll disclose the use and\nflag any errors.)\n\nThis applies not just to whole stories but also to snippets\u2014for\nexample, ordering up a few sentences of boilerplate on how Crispr works or what\nquantum computing is.\n\nIt also applies to editorial text on other platforms, such as\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich are already automated, we will disclose that.)\n\nThis is for obvious reasons: The current genai tools are prone to both errors and bias,\nand often produce dull, unoriginal writing.\n\nIn addition, we think someone who\nwrites for a living needs to constantly be thinking about the best way to express\ncomplex ideas in their own words.\n\nFinally, an genai tool may inadvertently plagiarize\nsomeone else\u2019s words.\n\nIf a writer uses it to create text for publication without a\ndisclosure, we\u2019ll treat that as tantamount to plagiarism.\n\nWe do not publish text edited by genai either.\n\nWhile using genai to, say, shrink an existing\n1,200-word story to 900 words might seem less problematic than writing a story\nfrom scratch, we think it still has pitfalls.\n\nAside from the risk that the genai tool will\nintroduce factual errors or changes in meaning, editing is also a matter of judgment\nabout what is most relevant, original, or entertaining about the piece.\n\nThis judgment\ndepends on understanding both the subject and the readership, neither of which genai\ncan do.\n\nWe may try using genai to suggest headlines or text for short social media posts.\n\nWe\ncurrently generate lots of suggestions manually, and an editor has to approve the\nfinal choices for accuracy.\n\nUsing an genai tool to speed up idea generation won\u2019t change\nthis process substantively.\n\nWe may try using genai to generate story ideas.\n\nAn genai might help the process of\nbrainstorming with a prompt like \u201cSuggest stories about the impact of genetic testing\non privacy,\u201d or \u201cProvide a list of cities where predictive policing has been\ncontroversial.\u201d This may save some time and we will keep exploring how this can be\nuseful.\n\nBut some limited testing we\u2019ve done has shown that it can also produce false\nleads or boring ideas.\n\nIn any case, the real work, which only humans can do, is in\nevaluating which ones are worth pursuing.\n\nWhere possible, for any genai tool we use,\nwe will acknowledge the sources it used to generate information.\n\nWe may experiment with using genai as a research or analytical tool.\n\nThe current\ngeneration of genai chatbots that Google and Microsoft are adding to their search\nengines answer questions by extracting information from large amounts of text and\nsummarizing it A reporter might use these tools just like a regular search engine or\n\n\n-----\n\nwill still have to go back to the original notes, documents, or recordings to check\nquotes and references.\n\nIn this sense, using an genai bot is like using Google Search or\nWikipedia: It might give you initial pointers, but you must follow the links back to\nthe original sources.\n\nIn practice, though, genai will make mistakes and miss things that a human would find\nrelevant\u2014perhaps so much so that it doesn\u2019t save any time.\n\nEven if these tools do\nprove useful, we won\u2019t want our reporters to rely on them any more than we\u2019d let\nthem rely on the limited information on Wikipedia.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to insist on the\nsame standards of research and original reporting as always.\n\nWe also know that\nthere are many professionally published research databases out there that come\nwith lawful and highly accurate text- and data-mining tools, so we will constantly\nevaluate whether those meet our needs.", "## Image Generators (e.g.\n\nDall-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)\n\nWe may publish genai-generated images or video, but only under certain\nconditions.\n\nSome working artists are now incorporating genai into their\ncreative process in much the same way that they use other digital tools.\n\nWe will\ncommission work from these artists as long as it involves significant creative input\nby the artist and does not blatantly imitate existing work or infringe copyright.\n\nIn\nsuch cases we will disclose the fact that genai was used.\n\nWe specifically do not use genai-generated images instead of stock\nphotography.\n\nSelling images to stock archives is how many working photographers\nmake ends meet.\n\nAt least until genai companies develop a way to\ncompensate the creators their tools rely on, we won\u2019t use their images this way.\n\nWe or the artists we commission may use genai tools to spark ideas.\n\nThis is the visual\nequivalent of brainstorming\u2014type in a prompt and see what comes up.\n\nBut if an\nartist uses this technique to come up with concepts, we will still require them to\ncreate original images using their normal process, and not merely reproduce what\nthe

I: Decoding the genai magic trick", "#### Decoding the genai\n\nmagic trick\n\nThe lofty expectations for genai depend\non continued progress and innovation across\nan interconnected hardware, software, and data\nprovider ecosystem.\n\nThe tech stack underlying genai,\nhowever, is in some ways similar to others\nthat came before.\n\nIt consists of three layers:\n\n**t**\n\ninfrastructure, platform, and applications.\n\n**Infrastructure is generally accepted** s\n**as the most established, stable, and**\n**commercialised layer.\n\n** Incumbents offer\ncompute, networking, and storage, including\naccess to specialised silicon\n(microprocessors) like NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs and\nGoogle\u2019s TPUs optimised for genai workloads.\n\nMeanwhile, the application layer is evolving\nrapidly and consists of leveraging and\nextending foundation models, which is s\ngenai\u2019s equivalent of a platform.\n\n-----\n\nSection I: Decoding the genai magic trick\n\ngenai Tech Stack", "**This could both disrupt and drive step**\n\n**changes in productivity across a range**\n**of capabilities, from copywriting to**\n**research and software engineering.\n\n** For\nexample, in advertising, genai could\ncreate original copy, product descriptions,\nand images in seconds.\n\nIt can generate\nsynthetic X-ray images in healthcare, helping\nphysician diagnostic training.\n\nIndeed, genai\ncould transform how\nbusinesses operate and\ninteract with customers\nand may even redefine\nan \u201cemployee\u201d as we\nknow it.\n\nThis transformation\nis already underway\nin some consumer and\nenterprise spaces.", "**Foundation Models, however, are what**\n\n**differentiate the genai tech**\n**stack from genai that came before.\n\n** At its\ncore, a Foundation Model, a term coined by\nStanford University\u2019s Centre for Research on\nFoundation Models, is a machine learning\n(ML) model pre-trained on a broad dataset\nthat can be adapted to solve a range of\nproblems.\n\n9 Just as Microsoft\u2019s Win32 offers\nAPIs for developers to access base-level\nhardware and OS functions, and NVIDIA\u2019s\nCUDA allows graphic-intensive applications\nlike game engines simplified access to GPU\nresources, the model layer is designed to\nconnect ambitious application developers to\noptimised hardware to help accelerate the\nadoption of and democratise genai.\n\nThese models are often available to\ndevelopers via closed and open APIs, where\ndevelopers can fine-tune models with\nadditional training data to improve context,\nrelevance, and performance to specific use\ncases, all while optimising delivery costs.\n\nFoundation models are typically developed\nin four stages, which are illustrated below.", "**Foundational Models**\n\nOpen or Close-source models\n\n\nWhile this framework is applicable across genai\narchitectures, state-of-the-art Foundation\nModels today (e.g., GPT-3, Stable Diffusion,\nMegatron-Turing) are based on a neural\nnetwork architecture called transformers,\ninvented by a team at Google Brain in\n2017.\n\n10 Transformers represent a step\nchange in ML performance and differ from\nprior architectures in their ability to assign\ncontext, track relationships, and predict\noutcomes.\n\nThe most mature Foundation\nModels today are in the text domain,\nprimarily driven by vast quantities of\navailable training data, which accelerated\nthe development of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), a type of genai foundational\nmodel.\n\nLLMs are trained to generate\ntext by predicting the next word in\na sequence or missing words within\na

II: Consumer and enterprise use cases\n\nfor genai\n\n\nDespite its promise, myriad challenges should\nbe overcome before genai can be deployed\nat scale.\n\nWe discuss these in more detail, but there\nis also the question of commercial viability.\n\nIn other\nwords, for all the fascinating possibilities and use cases\nfor genai, it still needs to be determined how\nvendors will build a sustainable business model.\n\nToday, there are ethical concerns with genai,\nincluding its potential for workforce displacement.\n\n16\nHowever, **like previous generations of genai, this**\n**technology will likely primarily augment human**\n**performance.\n\n** Indeed, genai could be commonplace\nin worker\u2019s toolkits, like Workspace among analysts,\nGitHub among coders, or Creative Cloud\namong marketers.\n\n6\n\nRegulatory actions will likely vary\nin speed, reach, oversight, and\nreporting requirements across\nmajor markets (e.g., US genai Bill\nof Rights, 13 EU genai Act, 14 China\nCyberspace Administration 15 ).\n\nAs", "**Text-based use cases will be commercialised**\n\n**first,** but the potential **cost and productivity**\n**gains may be greater when commercialising**\n**higher-order tasks** as these skills can be more\nexpensive to recruit, take longer to train, and\nare right-brain (creative) versus left-brain\n(logical), making success subjective.\n\nWhile horizontal use cases will likely be the first to\ndeliver value, vertical-specific use cases could\ncommand a premium due to the dependence on\nproprietary data.\n\nAs such, **data will be a currency,**\n**creating new economies for access to proprietary**\n**and synthetic data.\n\n**", "## 3\n\nsynthesis of prior knowledge.\n\nGiven the shift away from low-interest rates, costs will\nincrease, pushing enterprises to invest in use cases with\nclear ROI.\n\nAs such, **use cases that directly impact cost**\n(e.g., chatbots), **productivity** (e.g., search), or **revenue**\n(e.g., marketing copy) **could have greater adoption than**\n**those that eliminate humans.\n\n**\n\n\n-----\n\nSection III: Commerce and competition\n\nin genai", "#### Commerce and competition\n\nin genai\n\nThe battle for value capture will be fought\non multiple fronts, and each layer of the stack\nwill have its competitive dynamics driven\nby things like scale, data access, brand,\nand a captive customer base.\n\nHowever, we see two primary competitor\narchetypes: pure-play providers operating\nwithin a single layer\u2013infrastructure,\nmodel, and application - and integrated\nproviders that play in multiple layers.\n\nAs\nwith incumbent technology, we expect\nconsumer pricing to be simple (e.g., per\nuser, per month) and enterprise pricing\nto be more complex (e.g., per call, per\nhour, revenue share).\n\nHowever, **pricing**\n**simplicity, predictability, and value**\n**will be important to scaling within the**\n**enterprise beyond early adopters or**\n**edge use cases.\n\n**", "**To begin, the infrastructure layer, which**\n\n**is the most mature of the genai**\n**technology stack, is where hyperscalers**\n**dominate the market.\n\n** The

models.\n\n-----\n\nSection III: Commerce and competition\nin genai\n\nWhile the cloud service providers (CSP) deliver abstracted\nservices, there is another enabling layer within\ninfrastructure that is rapidly evolving: silicon.\n\nHere, NVIDIA is a leader with their Ampere\nand Hopper series GPUs purpose-built\nfor training and inference workloads,\nrespectively, coupled with their Selene\nsupercomputing clusters that speed\nup training time.\n\n20 Similarly, AMD\u2019s\nCDNA2 Architecture is purpose-built for\nexascale computing on machine learning\napplications, advancing

layer, where the market\nis evolving fast.\n\nThis area can be resource\nintensive; model builders must continually\nrevisit architectures (e.g., parameters,\nembeddings) to maintain performance.\n\nThey have to attract and retain genai talent\n(i.e., architects, engineers, and data\nscientists) to design the frameworks,\nguardrails, and learning mechanisms to\nensure the robustness and reliability of\nmodels.\n\nFinally, genai **workloads**\n**can run up large bills due to their**\n**compute-heavy nature and need for**\n**specialised silicon.\n\n** 22 No wonder

transpire slowly\nat first and then rapidly.\n\nTake software development as an example.\n\nBy some estimates, less than 1% of people\nknow how to code.\n\n24 Yet, **software**\n**is integral to many businesses and**\n**business models today.\n\nGenerative**\n**genai, if harnessed strategically, can**\n**democratise coding and reduce the gap**\n**between ideas and revenue** by\nsynthesising

use\ncases.\n\nSimilarly, genai can optimise the\nend-to-end customer acquisition funnel.\n\nIf you are in sales and marketing, consider\ndemand generation, where LLMs could\nauthor marketing copy across channels and\nrun digital marketing campaigns.\n\nGartner\nestimates that 30% of outbound marketing\nwill be synthetically generated by 2025.\n\n25\nFurther down the funnel, genai could\ngather account intelligence, create a first-call\npresentation, suggest a talk track to account\nexecutives, and document and track\n\n\noutcomes and actions.\n\nFinally, Generative\ngenai could proactively suggest pricing and\ndiscounting, author a contract, and update\ncustomer and CRM records.\n\nThis would\nallow marketers and sellers to focus on\nhigher-value activities, such as developing\nrelationships and applying pricing judgment.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed other ways that adopters\ncan leverage genai across industries\n(see section 2), from market research to note\ntaking and improving customer support\ninteractions.\n\nFurther, there are sectorised\nuse cases like customised financial planning\nfor wealth managers, medical diagnoses\nin health care, generating new

other\ntypes of media in response to prompts.\n\nAt the time of writing, these tools use\nlarge language models, which produce a result based on a set of training data.\n\nThe technology is not the same as search engine Eigenvector algorithms,\nmeaning that the results may be even less reliable than a Google fact search.\n\nThe technology is not the same as traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nchatbots, which often had human input to optimise the results for a particular\nuse case.\n\nThe training data is not usually linked to the internet or any other real-time\nupdates in most models.\n\nTherefore, any content will have no knowledge of\nevents since the model\u2019s last extraction date, which can be anything from\nmonths to years old.\n\nThese are narrow genai uses, meaning that a \u2018text generator\u2019 will produce beautiful\nnatural language but is not optimised for factual accuracy.\n\nAn \u2018image generator\u2019\nwill produce an impressive image

from around the world offers some answers.\n\nby Clark Merrefield | December 12, 2023 |\n\ngenai technology\n\n\n-----\n\n\ue900 \ue904 \ue907 \ue903 \ue90b **Republish This Article**\n\nIn July 2022, just a few newsrooms around the world had guidelines or policies for how their\njournalists and editors could use digital tools that run on genai.\n\nOne year later,\n\ndozens of influential, global newsrooms had formal documents related to the use of genai.\n\nIn between, genai research firm OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot that can\nproduce all sorts of written material when prompted: lines of code, plays, essays, jokes and\n\nnews-style stories.\n\nElon Musk and Sam Altman founded OpenAI in 2015 , with multibillion dollar\n\ninvestments over the years from Microsoft.\n\nNewsrooms including USA Today, The Atlantic, National Public Radio, the Canadian\nBroadcasting Corporation and the Financial Times have since developed genai guidelines or policies\n\n\u2014 a wave of recognition that genai chatbots could fundamentally change the way journalists do\ntheir work and how the public thinks about journalism.\n\nResearch posted during September 2023 on preprint server SocArXiv is among the first to\n\nexamine how newsrooms are handling the proliferating capabilities of genai-based platforms.\n\nPreprints have not undergone formal peer review and have not been published in an academic\njournal, though the current paper is under review at a prominent international journal according\n\nto one of the authors, Kim Bj\u00f6rn Becker , a lecturer at Trier University in Germany and a staff\nwriter for the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\nThe analysis provides a snapshot of the current state of genai policies and documents for 52 news\n\norganizations, including newsrooms in Brazil, India, North America, Scandinavia and Western\n\nEurope.\n\nNotably, the authors write that genai policies and documents from commercial news organizations,\n\ncompared with those that receive public funding, \u201cseem to be more fine-grained and contain\n\nsignificantly more information on permitted and prohibited applications.\u201d\n\nCommercial news organizations were also more apt to emphasize source protection, urging\njournalists to take caution when, for example, using genai tools for help making sense of large\n\namounts of confidential or background information, \u201cperhaps owing to the risk legal liability\n\nh i b i d l \u201d h i\n\n\n-----\n\nethics across the documents, as well as real world examples of genai being used in newsrooms \u2014\nplus, how the findings compare with other recent research.", "##### genai guidance and rules focus on preserving journalistic values\n\ngenai chatbots are a type of genai , meaning they create content when prompted.\n\nThey are\n\nbased on large language models , which themselves are trained on huge amounts of existing text.\n\n(OpenAI rivals Google and Meta in the past year have announced their own large language\n\nmodels).\n\nSo, when you ask an genai chatbot to write a three-act play, in the style of 19 century Norwegian th\n\nplaywright Henrik Ibsen , about the struggle for human self-determination in a future dominated\nby robots, it is able to do this because it has processed Ibsen\u2019s work along with the corpus of\n\nscience fiction about robots overtaking humanity.\n\nSome news organizations for years have used genai for published stories, notably the\nAssociated Press for simple coverage of earnings reports and college basketball game previews.\n\nOthers that have dabbled in genai-generated content have come under scrutiny for publishing\n\nconfusing or misleading information.\n\nThe authors of the recent preprint paper analyzed the genai policies and guidelines, most of them\n\nrelated to genai, to understand how publishers \u201caddress both expectations and concerns\n\nwhen it comes to using genai in the news,\u201d they write.\n\nThe most recent genai document in the dataset is from NPR, dated July 2023.\n\nThe oldest is from\nthe Council for Mass Media, a self-regulatory body of news organizations in Finland, dated\n\nJanuary 2020.\n\n\u201cOne thing that was remarkable to me is that the way in which organizations dealt with genai at this\nstage did exhibit a very strong sense of conserving journalistic values,\u201d says Becker.\n\n\u201cMany\n\norganizations were really concerned about not losing their credibility, not losing their audience,\n\nnot trying to give away what makes journalism stand out \u2014 especially in a world where\nmisinformation is around in a much larger scale than ever before.\u201d\n\nOther early adopters include the BBC and German broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk, \u201cwhich\n\nhave gained widespread attention through industry publications and conferences,\u201d and \u201chave\nserved as influential benchmarks for others,\u201d the authors write.\n\n-----\n\njournalists interact with and use genai, says Christopher Crum , a doctoral candidate at Oxford\nUniversity and another co-author.\n\nBut a few were prescriptive policies, Crum says.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nJust over 71% of the documents mention one or more journalistic values, such as public\n\nservice, objectivity, autonomy, immediacy \u2014 meaning publishing or broadcasting news\nquickly \u2014 and ethics.\n\nNearly 70% of the genai documents were designed for editorial staff, while most of the rest\n\napplied to an entire organization.\n\nThis would include the business side, which might use\ngenai for advertising or hiring purposes.\n\nOne policy only applied to the business side.\n\nAnd 69% mentioned genai pitfalls, such as \u201challucinations,\u201d the authors write, in which an genai\nsystem makes up facts.\n\nAbout 63% specified the guidelines would be updated at some point in the future \u2014 6% of\n\nthose \u201cspecified a particular interval for updates,\u201d the authors write \u2014 while 37% did not\nindicate if or when the policies would be updated.\n\nAround 54% of the documents cautioned journalists to be careful to protect sources when\n\nusing genai, with several addressing the potential risk of revealing confidential sources when\nfeeding information into an genai chatbot.\n\nSome 44% allow journalists to use genai to gather information and develop story ideas,\nangles and outlines.\n\nAnother 4% disallow this use, while half do not specify.\n\nMeanwhile, 42% allow journalists to use genai to alter editorial content, such as editing and\n\nupdating stories, while 6% disallow this use and half do not specify.\n\nOnly 8% state how the genai policies would be enforced, while the rest did not mention\n\naccountability mechanisms.", "##### How the research was conducted\n\nThe authors found about two-thirds of the genai policy documents online and obtained the\n\nremainder through professional and personal contacts.\n\nAbout two-fifths were written in English.\n\nThe authors translated the rest into English using DeepL, a translation service based on neural\n\nlearning , a backbone of genai.\n\nThey then used statistical software to break the documents into five-word blocks, to assess their\nsimilarity.\n\nIt\u2019s a standard way to linguistically compare texts, Crum says.\n\nHe explains that the\n\nphrase \u201cI see the dog run fast\u201d would have two five-word blocks: \u201cI see the dog run,\u201d and \u201csee the\n\ndog run fast.\u201d\n\n\n-----\n\nfirst block of five words would be the same, the second block different \u2014 and the overall\nsimilarity between the documents would be lower than if the sentences were identical.\n\nAs a benchmark for comparison, the authors performed the same analysis on the news\n\norganizations\u2019 editorial guidelines.\n\nThe editorial guidelines were a bit more similar than the genai\nguidelines, the authors find.\n\n\u201cBecause of the additional uncertainty in the [genai] space, the finding is that the genai guidelines are\n\ncoalescing at a slightly lower degree than existing editorial guidelines,\u201d Crum says.\n\n\u201cThe\n\npotential explanation might be, and this is speculative and not in the paper, something along the\nlines of, editorial guidelines have had more time to coalesce, whereas genai guidelines at this stage,\n\nwhile often influenced by existing genai guidelines, are still in the nascent stages of development.\u201d\n\nThe authors also manually identified overarching characteristics of the documents relating to\njournalistic ethics, transparency and human supervision of genai.\n\nAbout nine-tenths of the\n\ndocuments specified that if genai were used in a story or investigation, that had to be disclosed.\n\n\u201cMy impression is not that organizations are afraid of genai,\u201d Becker says.\n\n\u201cThey encourage\nemployees to experiment with this new technology and try to make some good things out of it \u2014\n\nfor example, being faster in their reporting, being more accurate, if possible, finding new angles,\n\nstuff like that.\n\nBut at the same time, indicating that, under no circumstances, shall they pose a\nrisk on journalistic credibility.\u201d", "##### genai in the newsroom is evolving\n\nThe future of genai in the newsroom is taking shape, whether that means journalists primarily\n\nusing genai as a tool in their work, or whether newsrooms become broadly comfortable with using\ngenai to produce publicly facing content.\n\nThe Journalist\u2019s Resource has used DALL.E 2 , an OpenAI\n\nproduct, to create images to accompany human-reported and written research roundups and\n\narticles.\n\nJournalists, editors and newsroom leaders should, \u201cengage with these new tools, explore them\nand their potential, and learn how to pragmatically apply them in creating and delivering value\n\nto audiences,\u201d researcher and consultant David Caswell writes in a September 2023 report for\nthe Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford.\n\n\u201cThere are no best practices,\n\ntextbooks or shortcuts for this yet, only engaging, doing and learning until a viable way forward\n\nappears.\n\nCaution is advisable, but waiting for complete clarity is not.\u201d\n\n\n-----\n\nquarterly earnings reports.\n\nBut recently, the organization\u2019s genai guidelines released during August\n2023 specify that genai \u201ccannot be used to create publishable content and images for the news\n\nservice.\u201d\n\nThe AP had partnered with genai-content generation firm Automated Insights to produce the\nearnings stories, The Verge reported in January 2015.\n\nThe AP also used Automated Insights to\n\ngenerate more than 5,000 previews for NCAA Division I men\u2019s basketball games during the 2018\n\nseason.\n\nEarly this year, Futurism staff writer Frank Landymore wrote that tech news outlet CNET had\nbeen publishing genai-generated articles.\n\nOver the summer, Axios\u2019 Tyler Buchanan reported USA\n\nToday was pausing its use of genai to create high school sports stories after several such articles in\nThe Columbus Dispatch went viral for peculiar phrasing, such as \u201ca close encounter of the\n\nathletic kind.\u201d\n\nAnd on Nov. 27, Futurism published an article by Maggie Harrison citing anonymous sources\n\nalleging that Sports Illustrated has recently been using genai-generated content and authors, with\ngenai-generated headshots, for articles on product reviews.\n\nSenior media writer Tom Jones of the Poynter Institute wrote the next day that the \u201cstory has\n\nagain unsettled journalists concerned about genai-created content, especially when you see a name\nsuch as Sports Illustrated involved.\u201d\n\nThe Arena Group, which publishes Sports Illustrated, posted a statement on X the same day the\n\nFuturism article was published, denying that Sports Illustrated had published genai-generated\narticles.\n\nAccording to the statement, the product review articles produced by a third-party\n\ncompany, AdVon Commerce, were \u201cwritten and edited by humans,\u201d but \u201cAdVon had writers use\n\na pen or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy \u2014

published \u2014\n\nand publicly accessible, Becker says.\n\nCrum adds that the research team was \u201cagnostic\u201d in its approach \u2014 not for or against newsrooms\nusing genai \u2014 with the

Felix Simon , a communication researcher and\ndoctoral student at Oxford, are among a growing body of scholars and journalists interested in\n\ninforming how newsrooms use genai.\n\nIn July, University of Amsterdam postdoctoral researcher Hannes Cools and Northwestern\n\nUniversity communications professor Nick Diakopoulos published an article for the Generative\ngenai in the Newsroom project , which Diakopoulos edits, examining publicly available genai guidelines\n\nfrom 21 newsrooms .\n\nCools and Diakopoulos read the documents and identified themes.\n\nThe guidelines generally\nstress the need for human oversight.\n\nCools and Diakopoulos examined genai documents from many\n\nof the same newsrooms as the preprint authors, including the CBC, Insider, Reuters, Nucleo ,\n\nWired and Mediahuis , among others.\n\n\u201cAt least for the externally facing policies, I don\u2019t see them as enforceable policies,\u201d says\n\nDiakopoulos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like principal statements: \u2018Here\u2019s our goals as an organization.\u2019\n\nAs for feeding confidential material into genai chatbots, Diakopoulos says that the underlying issue\n\nis about potentially sharing that information with a third party \u2014 OpenAI, for example \u2014 not in\nusing the chatbot itself.\n\nThere are \u201cversions of genai that run locally on your own\n\ncomputer or on your own server,\u201d and those should be unproblematic to use as a journalistic\ntool, he says.\n\n\u201cThere was also what I call hybridity,\u201d Diakopoulos says.\n\n\u201cKind of the need to have humans and\n\nalgorithms working together, hybridized into human-computer systems, in order to keep the\n\n\n-----\n\ninvestigations.\u201d\n\nFor local and regional newsrooms interested in developing their own guidelines, there may be\nlittle need to reinvent the wheel.\n\nThe Paris Charter , developed among 16 organizations and\n\ninitiated by Reporters

not limited to writing,\nresearch, analysis, and customer service.\n\nAt Maergo, we embrace new technologies\nand encourage our teams to leverage them to improve efficiency and effectiveness, and\nenable the achievement of our objectives.\n\nHowever, it is vitally important that employees\nuse genai responsibly while remaining compliant with all existing company\npolicies and all applicable laws.\n\nWe are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our employees,\npartners, and customers and this includes our responsible use of genai tooling.\n\nThis policy outlines the guidelines and principles that employees must follow when\nusing genai capabilities.\n\nThe company developed these guidelines so that we\ncan experience the benefits of genai tooling while ensuring its utilization is\nsecure and aligned with our expectations for conduct and our internal data privacy\ncontrols.", "**Guiding Principles**\n\nThere are two main principles that guide the Maergo approach to genai and the\nentirety of this policy centers on these ideas:\n\n1. genai should be used to assist employees in their work, not perform their\n\nwork.\n\n2.\n\nAll existing company policies apply to the utilization of genai.\n\n**genai should be used to assist employees in their work, not perform their**\n**work.\n\n** Employees are responsible for their work product and

2023** \u2013 In response to major advances in genai technologies\u2014as well as\nthe significant questions these technologies pose in areas including intellectual property, the future of\nwork, and even human safety\u2014the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s global Technology Policy\nCouncil (ACM TPC) has issued \u201c Principles for the Development, Deployment, and Use of genai\nTechnologies .\u201d\n\nDrawing on the deep technical expertise of computer scientists in the United States and Europe, the\nACM TPC statement outlines eight principles intended to foster fair, accurate, and beneficial decisionmaking concerning generative and all other genai technologies.\n\nFour of the principles are specific to\ngenai, and an additional four principles are adapted from the TPC\u2019s 2022 \u201c Statement on\nPrinciples for Responsible Algorithmic Systems .\u201d\n\nThe Introduction to the new Principles advances the core argument that \u201cthe increasing power of\ngenai systems, the speed of their evolution, broad application, and potential to cause significant\nor even catastrophic harm, means that great care must be taken in researching, designing, developing,\ndeploying, and using them.\n\nExisting mechanisms and modes for avoiding such harm likely will not\nsuffice.\u201d\n\nThe document then sets out these eight instrumental principles, outlined here in abbreviated form:\n\n**genai-Specific Principles**\n\n-  **Limits and guidance on deployment and use:** In consultation with all stakeholders, law and\nregulation should be reviewed and applied as written or revised to limit the deployment and use\nof genai technologies when required to minimize harm.\n\nNo high-risk genai system should\n\n\n-----\n\nbe allowed to operate without clear and adequate safeguards, including a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d\nand clear consensus among relevant stakeholders that the system's benefits will substantially\noutweigh its potential negative impacts.\n\nOne approach is to define a hierarchy of risk levels,\nwith unacceptable risk at the highest level and minimal risk at the lowest level.\n\n-  **Ownership:** Inherent aspects of how genai systems are structured and function are not\n\nyet adequately accounted for in intellectual property (IP) law and regulation.\n\n-  **Personal data control:** genai systems should allow a person to opt out of their data\n\nbeing used to train a system or facilitate its generation of information.\n\n-  **Correctability:** Providers of genai systems should create and maintain public\n\nrepositories where errors made by the system can be noted and, optionally, corrections made.", "**Adapted Prior Principles**\n\n-  **Transparency:** Any application or system that utilizes genai should conspicuously\n\ndisclose that it does so to the appropriate stakeholders.\n\n-  **Auditability and contestability:** Providers of genai systems should ensure that system\n\nmodels, algorithms, data, and outputs can be recorded where possible (with due consideration\nto privacy), so that they may be audited and/or contested in appropriate cases.\n\n-  **Limiting environmental impact:** Given the large environmental impact of genai models,\n\nwe recommend that consensus on methodologies be developed to measure, attribute, and\nactively reduce such impact.\n\n-  **Heightened security and privacy:** genai systems are susceptible to a broad range of new\n\nsecurity and privacy risks, including new attack vectors and malicious data leaks, among others.\n\n\u201cOur field needs to tread carefully with the development of genai because this is a new\nparadigm that goes significantly beyond previous genai technology and applications,\u201d explained Ravi Jain,\nChair of the ACM Technology Policy Council\u2019s Working Group on genai and lead author of the\nPrinciples.\n\n\"Whether you celebrate genai as a wonderful scientific advancement or fear it,\neveryone agrees that we need to develop this technology responsibly.\n\nIn outlining these eight\ninstrumental principles, we\u2019ve tried to consider a wide range of areas where genai might have\nan impact.\n\nThese include aspects that have not been covered as much in the media, including\nenvironmental considerations and the idea of creating public repositories where errors in a system can\nbe noted and corrected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are guidelines, but we must also build a community of scientists, policymakers, and industry\nleaders who will work together in the public interest to understand the limits and risks of genai\n\n\n-----\n\nas well as its benefits.\n\nACM\u2019s position as the world\u2019s largest association for computing professionals\nmakes us well-suited to foster that consensus and look forward to working with policy makers to craft\nthe regulations by which genai should be developed, deployed, but also controlled,\u201d added\nJames Hendler, Professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Chair of ACM\u2019s Technology Policy\nCouncil.\n\n\u201cPrinciples for the Development, Deployment, and Use of genai Technologies\u201d was jointly\nproduced

available.\n\nWhile GenAI\ncan provide significant benefits to an organization in terms of productivity enhancement and revenue generation, it\nalso poses risks to privacy, cybersecurity, intellectual property, third-party/client engagements, legal obligations, and\nregulatory compliance.\n\nThis policy aims to forge a responsible usage, deployment and development of genai across Wipro, harness\nthe advantages that the GenAI technology bring whilst mitigating the risks and challenges, and provide guidelines for\nresponsible usage, deployment and development of GenAI tools for internal use and client engagement.", "**Scope**\n\nThis policy covers usage, deployment and development of genai tools and technology.\n\nThis policy does not override any policy, process and guidance related to privacy, data protection, code of business\nconduct, intellectual property, and confidentiality.\n\nFor example, any use case related to the deployment of Generative\ngenai for internal utilization (e.g., to optimize HR processes, sales, and marketing campaigns, etc.\n\n), must undertake all\nthe existing procedures, including security assessment, intellectual property and confidentiality due diligence, and\nprivacy assessment when personal data is involved.\n\nThis policy is a living document as it reflects the fast-evolving nature of technology, which we embrace in a\nresponsible, human-centric, sustainable and privacy preserving manner, in full adherence to the spirit of Wipro.", "**Policy Details**\n\ngenai refers to genai systems that have the capability of generating new content (such as\nimages, text, audio, codes, presentation, etc.)\n\nbased on the data they were trained on.\n\nWhile genai can\nrevolutionize the way we operate, there are inherent risks associated with this technology.\n\nThese risks include but are not limited to:\n\n-  **Privacy and data protection.\n\n** genai tools require large datasets thus pose issues related to data\nminimization and legal basis for processing data.\n\nThese are core privacy law tenets now recognised all\nacross the globe, and ones we must abide to.\n\nIn addition, these tools present risks around fairness in both\nprocessing and outputs; opacity around the workings of genai may clash with transparency and\ninformational right requirements.\n\nFinally, there are challenges around accuracy as genai tools may\nproduce false information.\n\n-  **Security and confidentiality.\n\n** Through genai, attackers may generate new and complex types of\nmalware, phishing schemes and other cyber dangers that can avoid conventional protection measures.\n\nSuch\nassaults may have significant repercussions like data breaches, financial losses, and reputational risks.\n\nIn\n\n\n-----\n\naddition to personal data leakage risks, the use and development of genai is also susceptible to data\ninference attacks, data poisoning and other forms of adversarial attacks that may compromise the security\nand confidentiality of data.\n\n-  **Intellectual property and enterprise proprietary information.\n\n** All aspects of genai from the\nmodel, training data, prompts, to output pose IP risks namely:\n\n`o` _Infringement of IP Rights:_ The training data used to train the genai models could include\ncopyrighted material and if the output of these models is the similar (or a derivative work) or in\nrare scenarios, the exact same as the input training data, then this could potentially infringe on\ncopyright laws.\n\ngenai could inadvertently use or refer to trademarked products, brands or\nlogos that could also be seen as infringing on those trademarks.\n\nThe machine authored output\ncould also be very realistic fake images, videos, or texts, which could be used to infringe on\nsomeone's copyright.\n\nThe prompts used to interact with genai systems may contain\ncopyright-protected information, which could lead to infringement.\n\n`o` _Unclear Ownership_ : The issue of IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) protection for machine\nauthored content is an unclear, complex and evolving area of law.\n\nWhen integrated into Wipro or\nClient owned IP, it can result in downstream IP licensing and/or enforcement risks and challenges.\n\n`o` _Attribution:_ genai generated content can be almost indistinguishable from human generated content\nand as such can lead to a risk of humans not getting due credit and attribution as the rights holder\nof their work.\n\n-  **Misinformation.\n\n** genai can produce biased or inaccurate outputs and potentially lead to poor\ndecision-making and legal or ethical consequences.\n\ngenai can also create content and represent facts\neven if they don\u2019t exist.\n\nIn addition, the outdated data on which it is trained can lead to inaccurate predictions,\npoor recommendations.\n\n-  **Consumer Protection.\n\n** Businesses that fail to disclose usage of large language models to consumers run the\nrisk of losing customer trust and be charged with unfair practices under various laws (e.g.\n\nthe California\nchatbot law mandates that in certain consumer interactions, organizations must disclose clearly and\nconspicuously that a consumer is communicating with a bot.)", "**1.\n\n** **Guidelines for Users**\n\nUsers of genai (\u201cusers\u201d) refers to personnels accessing and

to obtain clearance for the usage Generative\ngenai tools in all new and existing client engagement.\n\n-  GenAI tools that are not approved by Wipro for enterprise-wide use should not be used for any\nactivity.\n\n-  Any genai use case must be reviewed and approved by GenAI Steering Committee\n(GenAI Steerco) before implementation or deployment.\n\nUsers must submit a GenAI use case\nreview request to _GenAI taskforce._\n\n-  Any genai use case involving personal data and/or has an impact to the data privacy rights\nof individuals must undergo a Data Protection Impact Assessment.\n\n-

proactive and create a policy\n\ngoverning use of the new technology, attorneys say.\n\nLawyers at one company initiated a process to write a policy after\n\nhearing employees were already using it, Kim Phan of law firm\n\nTroutman Pepper said in a webcast hosted by the firm\n\n\u201cThe legal folks learned just through water cooler chat that folks\n\nwere starting to use genai,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey were fortunate enough to\n\nhave a company that has the resources to devote to thinking about\n\nthis.\u201d\n\nCompanies are playing catch-up because employees are ahead of\n\nthem on use of the technology, said Peter Wakiyama, also of\n\nTroutman Pepper.\n\n\u201cThis is probably most companies right now,\u201d\n\nhe said.\n\ngenai differs from more familiar versions of the technology\n\nby using information provided in prompts to create, rather than\n\nanalyze, content.\n\nLawyers have started using it in some cases to\n\n\n-----\n\nwrite the first draft of a brief or non-legal communication, among\n\nother things.", "## Starting the process\n\nTo write a policy governing genai use for your\n\norganization, there are six steps in-house teams should consider,\n\nPhan said.\n\nThe first is to let everyone at the organization know you\u2019re\n\nplanning the policy so once you get going the process won\u2019t be a\n\nsurprise.\n\n\u201cThe first communication needs to be about transparency, leading\n\nyour employees toward the direction as a top-down approach your\n\ncompany wants to take,\u201d she said.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to assemble a team from all of the parts of the\n\norganization that will be touched by the technology.\n\nIt can make\n\nsense for legal and HR to take the lead, but also important are IT,\n\nR&D, communications, marketing and sales.\n\nThe team should come to agreement on the organization\u2019s risk\n\ntolerance because that will help determine the depth and breadth\n\nof the policy.\n\nTechnology companies that have been using genai for a\n\nwhile might be expected to be more risk tolerant than others, but\n\nnailing this down for your organization is crucial.\n\n\u201cCompanies have different appetites for risk, but this is a starting\n\npoint,\u201d said Wakiyama.", "## Surveying stakeholders\n\nIn the next step, develop a survey to send to employees to learn\n\nhow they\u2019re already using genai, if they are, and under\n\n\n-----\n\nwhat scenarios they would like to use it and not use it.\n\n\u201cThe survey may even differ from department to department,\u201d said\n\nWakiyama.\n\n\u201cSo, put out your survey \u2013 you can use an electronic\n\nsurvey tool for that \u2013 and gather the results so you\u2019re making the\n\ndecision based on actionable information.\u201d\n\nAs responses come in, the team can devise scenarios for how the\n\ntechnology should and shouldn\u2019t be used.\n\n\u201cAre those the right use cases for our company?\u201d said Phan.\n\n\u201cThe\n\ncritical stakeholders \u2013 legal, HR, IT, others \u2013 get together and\n\nthink about that.\u201d\n\nBased on her work with clients, Phan said, she\u2019s seen a range of use\n\ncases, especially that apply to coders in engineering.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re\n\ntreating genai the same way they might incorporate open\n\nsource coding data into their systems,\u201d she said.\n\nCoders have been quick to adopt genai because it can help them work\n\nfaster, said Gerard Lewis, former deputy general counsel at\n\nComcast.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve used it for rapid prototyping and deployment of new\n\ntechnologies,\u201d said Lewis in the webcast.\n\n\u201cIt lets developers create\n\nquickly and get something stood up in record time to see if an idea\n\nor logic flow works.\u201d\n\nOutside of engineering, other use cases that are being tried include\n\nfirst drafts of documents.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re using it to produce an initial\n\ndraft of internal or customer service communications, with some\n\nhuman intervention to tailor it,\u201d Phan said.\n\n\u201cAnd the marketing\n\nteam is using it for jingles, slogans and other content.\u201d", "## Policy outline\n\n-----\n\nOnce the team has developed, vetted and received approval on a\n\nlist of use cases, it should create a policy outline that it sends\n\naround to get buy-in from leadership and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe outline is critical,\u201d said Wakiyama.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the foundation for the\n\npolicy.\n\nShare it with all the stakeholders and those who need to put\n\nthe policy out there in the field and answer questions about it.\u201d\n\nWhen the outline has been given wide exposure, the team drafts\n\nthe policy, which should include a list of acceptable and prohibited\n\nuses.\n\nIt should also highlight the process employees follow to get\n\nexceptions approved.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re OK with employees exploring, figuring out what\n\nmakes sense for them,\u201d said Phan.\n\n\u201cMaybe you want to have more\n\nlevel of control or you want employees to vet new use cases with\n\nyou.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want the exception process to be too rigid, otherwise you\n\nrisk employees ignoring it and experimenting with genai\n\noutside the policy.\n\n\u201cEmployees [could] try to circumvent the process and then you\n\nhave non-compliance,\u201d she said.\n\nSo you want the process to be\n\nsmooth \u2014 \u201ca documented way for employees to acknowledge the\n\nprohibition but still take a clear path to get an exception.\u201d\n\nThe policy should also include sections on recordkeeping and use\n\nlogs, security, privacy, IP rights and new tools.", "## Iterative process\n\nSetting up a process for recordkeeping and administering a use log\n\ncan be burdensome but they\u2019re needed for measuring how the\n\n\n-----\n\norganization is using genai and whether it\u2019s having an\n\neffect on operations.\n\n\u201cUnless this information is collected, it\u2019s difficult for the\n\norganization to know if the use of genai is beneficial,\u201d said Wakiyama.\n\n\u201cAnd if someone asks about it \u2014 a commercial insurer, for example\n\n\u2014 if they have that on a questionnaire for commercial insurance,\n\nthe organization won\u2019t have the information if it\u2019s not being kept\n\non an ongoing basis.\u201d\n\nOnce the policy is out, you want to disseminate it the way you\n\nwould any other policy.\n\nThat could mean an email blast to all\n\nemployees or something else.\n\nTraining is also important, both to help ensure employee\n\ncompliance but also as a way to get buy-in.\n\n\u201cWe know employees often don\u2019t read policies in full, so training\n\ncan enhance adoption and compliance,\u201d said Wakiyama.\n\nThe last piece is about keeping the policy updated.\n\nThat could\n\nmean going out on a regular basis with the survey to learn how\n\nemployees are using, or are wanting to use, the new tools.\n\nUpdating could also include adding new acceptable or prohibited\n\nuses, incorporating regulatory compliance as needed and making\n\nsure the policy doesn\u2019t conflict with your organization\u2019s other\n\npolicies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an evolving area,\u201d said Wakiyama.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s new in terms of case\n\nlaw, regulations.\n\nIt\u2019s changing daily.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing new cases, early\n\ndecisions.\n\nThe policy [should] evolve along with the genai landscape,\n\nand as the organization obtains feedback on how and where it\u2019s\n\nbeing used, you can update accordingly.\u201d\n\n\n-----", "### Supercharged productivity or mass joblessness?\n\nIn brief\n\n\n\n-  genai (genai)

potential\nto accelerate innovation could make productivity gains\neven more significant.\n\n-  genai will also have significant implications for labor.\n\nAutomating some tasks means needing fewer human\nworkers to produce the same output, which could result\nin transitional job displacement, put downward pressure\non wages and increase income inequality.\n\nHowever, if genai\ntechnologies stimulate demand, the creation of new jobs\nand higher overall economic growth should offset job\ndisplacement.\n\n-  genai may fundamentally change the way we, as humans,\ndrive value in the workplace, requiring us to focus on the\nskills where we have a comparative advantage.\n\nThese\nchanges may be rapid and unpredictable, increasing the\nimportance of career flexibility, re-training and effective\naction from governments.\n\n-  For markets, genai-driven productivity gains are likely to be\npositive for corporate earnings and equity returns ;\nimplications for bonds are more ambiguous, though we\nthink the most likely impact is modestly higher yields.\n\n-  We remain humble in our projections of the economic and\nmarket implications of genai technologies, given tremendous\nuncertainty over how powerful and capable they can\nbecome, what kinds of unforeseen innovations and\nindustry transformations they\u2019ll cause and, ultimately,\nhow governments and

Morgan Asset Management.\n\nUltimately, the greatest uncertainties in estimating the\nlabor productivity boost involve the capabilities of genai\nitself.\n\nOur more conservative estimates of genai capabilities,\nassuming a broader range of tasks are immune to\nautomation, would see productivity gains of just 0.4%0.9% per year over 10 years; on the other hand, our\nmost optimistic assumptions would see gains of as\nmuch as 7.7% per year.\n\nTo be sure, we think this upside\nis extremely unlikely, but its possibility does illustrate\nthe significance automation could have dependent on\nhow powerful and pervasive genai ultimately becomes.\n\nSimilarly, if our baseline scenario for genai automation were\nto take 20 rather than 10 years to take hold, then annual\nproductivity gains would be proportionally smaller, i.e.,\n0.7%-1.4% per year.\n\nOur 2024 forthcoming **Long-Term Capital Market**\n**Assumptions** (LTCMAs) will incorporate a small first\nstep in accounting for the role of genai technologies,\nparticularly genai, in automating current\neconomic activity.\n\nAlthough we feel it is too early\nto fully embed the plausible productivity upsides\nestimated in this paper into our base-case\nlong-run assumptions, we plan to re-evaluate\nthis impact in the coming years and size the\nproductivity gain depending on the progress made\non automation.\n\n-----", "## Work in an age of genai automation\n\nTransforming existing jobs\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, genai will _augment_ but not\nentirely replace human capabilities.\n\nWhile genai\u2019s abilities\nare impressive, there are many domains where genai\ntechnologies still fall short compared to humans or\nbenefit from a layer of human supervision and feedback.\n\nAs repetitive and time-consuming \u201cgrunt work\u201d\nbecomes automated, workers can spend more of their\ntime on higher complexity tasks, meaningful criticalthinking or creative endeavors.\n\nAs such, automation can\nalso provide humans with the opportunity to deepen\ntheir skills, thereby expanding their overall potential and\neven increasing happiness at work.\n\n31\n\nConsider a couple of instances where we already see\nthis dynamic playing out.\n\n-  \u0007 Financial \u201crobo-advisers\u201d can provide customized\ninvestment advice and algorithmic portfolio\nmanagement.\n\nA human financial adviser, though, is\nstill needed to provide appropriate advice on financial\nmatters involving complexity, counsel against\nimpulsive trading behavior during market crashes or\nbubbles and offer empathy in times of crisis.\n\nCombine\na human financial adviser with the tools of a roboadviser, and this new \u201cteam\u201d has both the benefit of\nadvanced technology, as well as a layer of emotional\nintelligence for when contextual understanding is\nnecessary.\n\n-  \u0007 Similarly, for software engineers, genai can\nsignificantly reduce time spent on research and\ntrial and error, especially when working with a new\nprogramming language or software framework.\n\nWith\nthese time savings, one study found that developers\nwere 25-30% more likely to complete higher\ncomplexity tasks within the same time limit.\n\n32\n\n\ngenai may bring on considerable productivity gains, but by\ndoing so through automation, the idea that robots will\n\u201ctake our jobs\u201d is becoming a popular concern.\n\nAre we\nin for mass unemployment?\n\nWe don\u2019t think so \u2013 at least not in the foreseeable future\n\u2013 but the future of work will likely look quite different.\n\nAutomating tasks, not jobs\n\ngenai seems unlikely to automate many _entire jobs,_ but it\ndoes have significant potential to automate many of\nthe _tasks_ involved in those jobs, with most estimates\nof aggregate task exposure to automation ranging\nfrom 20% to 30%.\n\n29 Such exposure will be broad-based\nacross industries; OpenAI estimates that LLMs could\naffect 80% of the U.S. workforce in some form.\n\n30\n\nThe degree of exposure, however, varies considerably by\njob type.\n\nHighly exposed jobs include those responsible\nfor documentation and review in legal professions,\nproviding administrative support in businesses and\ncustomer service representatives.\n\nGiven genai\u2019s\nadvanced abilities to understand language and draw\nupon vast bodies of information, exposed tasks include\nthose that involve a degree of knowledge or expertise.\n\nAs such, higher-skilled jobs, such as STEM professionals\nand health care providers, are also exposed.\n\nAt the\nopposite end of the spectrum, where tasks seem the\nleast exposed to automation, are jobs involving physical\nwork or where the human component is invaluable\n(i.e., construction workers and daycare providers).\n\n29 \u0007 McKinsey estimates that genai and other technologies have the potential to automate 30% of current hours worked today in the United States by\n2030.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates that roughly two-thirds of the U.S. workforce may be exposed to some degree of automation from genai, with up to onefourth fully substituted.\n\nThe OECD estimates that 27% of jobs in major countries are at high risk of automation.\n\n30 \u0007 OpenAI, OpenResearch and the University of Pennsylvania estimate that 80% of the U.S. workforce would have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by\nLLMs, with 19% of workers seeing at least 50% of tasks impacted.\n\nSee Tyna Eloundou et al., \u201cGPTs Are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact\nPotential of Large Language Models,\u201d ArXiv (Cornell University), March 17, 2023.\n\n31 \u0007 Survey results from the OECD\u2019s 2023 Employment Outlook found that 63% of workers in finance and manufacturing said using genai in the workplace\nimproved their enjoyment in the job.\n\nSimilarly, Noy and Zhang (2023) found that exposure to Chat-GPT among participants using the tool for writing tasks\nwas associated with a substantial increase in job satisfaction of 0.40 standard deviations.\n\n32 \u0007 Deniz et al., \u201cUnleashing Developer Productivity with genai.\u201d\n\n\n-----\n\nThis pivot will require workers to focus on skills where\nhumans have a comparative advantage ( Exhibit 8 ).\n\nHuman intelligence can still better understand context\nand matters of complexity, apply intuition and employ\nemotional intelligence in social settings or where\ncultural norms are relevant.\n\nPlace a human professional\nin a room full of potential new clients, and within minutes\nshe can adapt and respond to social cues across all five\nsenses, adjusting everything from her handshake to the\nlevel of detail in her presentation.", "Humans also still have some edge in conceptual\nthinking.\n\nEach human mind is intrinsically capable\nof developing or working with an infinite number of\nabstract representations and models of the world\n\u2013 from solving physics problems to deciding how to\nstructure an organization.\n\nNo form of genai boasts such\ngeneral abilities.\n\nTraditional genai applications can work\nwith some such abstract representations, albeit only for\nthe relatively narrow set of instances for which they are\ndesigned.\n\ngenai chatbots, despite producing\nnovel content across a wide variety of domains, do so\nby essentially echoing patterns in the troves of text on\nwhich they are trained.\n\nSince this process involves no\nunderlying conceptualization, it falls short in purely\nconceptual domains like mathematics, as we noted\nearlier.\n\nPerhaps also owing to this edge in conceptual\nunderstanding, humans should maintain an edge in\nartistic creativity.\n\nWhile genai might soon be able to create\na lot of music and visual art that sounds or looks like\nwhat has already been produced, it seems less likely to\ngenerate entirely new genres on its own.\n\nWhere genai\u2019s capabilities fall short, humans will be needed\nto fill in the gaps, and the jobs of tomorrow will be\nincreasingly focused in these areas.\n\nNaturally, these\nare also the sorts of skills we will want to emphasize in\neducation and job training, but many tough questions\nremain.\n\nCan everyone be a great problem-solver?\n\nHow\ndo we evaluate and train such skills?\n\nDo we need to\nfoster creativity in classes, instead of teaching students\nhow to write code?\n\ngenai has some clear advantages,\nincluding in its ability to process information at a speed\nimpossible for humans to match.\n\nIn these cases, leaning\non genai can expand our overall potential.\n\nExhibit 8: Humans and genai should still have distinct\ncomparative advantages\n\n**genai now outperforms average humans on:**\n\nHandwriting, speech and imagine recognition*\n\nReading

Morgan\nAsset Management estimates utilizing data sourced from realtimeinequality.org.\n\n39 \u0007 \u0007 The ratio of U.S. financial assets relative to nominal GDP has grown from 2.3x in the late 1970s to about 4.3x today.\n\n40 \u0007 \u0007 Acemoglu and Restrepo argue that a significant portion of the rise in US wage inequality over the last four decades has been driven by automation (and to\na lesser extent offshoring) displacing certain workgroups from employment opportunities for which they had comparative advantage.\n\nSee Acemoglu,\nDaron, and Pascual Restrepo.\n\n\u201cTasks, Automation, and the Rise in US Wage Inequality,\u201d NBER, June 1, 2021.\n\n-----\n\nA key pitfall of automation is that it can lead to the\nconcentration of gains in the holders of capital, at least\ninitially.\n\nIf some part of what a worker does is replaced\nwith an genai program, then the owner of that genai capital will\nreceive the \u201cwages\u201d the worker used to earn.\n\nWhile this\nmay propel gains for technology companies, and their\ninvestors, this dynamic doesn\u2019t bode well for labor\u2019s\nshare of income, particularly in an economy where\nworker bargaining power has already dwindled.\n\n41 Over\ntime, these inequalities can fade, as cost savings from\nautomation pass through to consumer prices and\nas new jobs emerge that reemploy displaced labor.\n\nHowever, while the U.S. economy has maintained full\nemployment, there is some evidence that automation\nhas been outpacing the creation of new tasks and jobs\nin recent decades.\n\n42 If so, genai could complicate\nthis challenge by further narrowing the set of skills that\nare uniquely human, increasingly including those of\nhigher-skilled white-collar professionals who largely\nescaped the effects of prior waves of automation.\n\nMixed effects among workers\n\nAmong workers, the greatest beneficiaries are likely\nto be those whose skills are _complementary_ to genai,\nrather than replaced by it.\n\nThose who work in such\ncomplementary roles already tend to earn relatively\nmore, and increased demand for their skills could add\nto inequality among workers.\n\nConsider a hypothetical\ncustomer service center that is made significantly more\nefficient by genai.\n\nCustomer-facing workers may\nexperience a direct productivity enhancement, but\nefficiency gains mean needing fewer of them to produce\nthe same output, leaving them exposed to replacement.", "Customer-facing workers may\nexperience a direct productivity enhancement, but\nefficiency gains mean needing fewer of them to produce\nthe same output, leaving them exposed to replacement.\n\nBy contrast, a manager of this center who effectively\ndevelops and maintains systems that integrate the work\nof humans and genai would be performing work that is\nmore complementary to genai.\n\nAt the same time, genai technologies can level\nthe playing field between lower-skilled and higherskilled workers, by \u201clending\u201d expertise to those who lack\nit, without the need for formal training and investment.\n\nThese skill-leveling effects might slightly offset inequality\namong workers.\n\nRecent studies on the impact of\nChatGPT on customer service workers 43\n44\nand on collegeeducated professional performing writing tasks found\nthat the greatest productivity gains came from novice\nand low-skilled workers.\n\nHigher performers saw less\nbenefit, perhaps because they were already delivering\nresults closer to their peak potential, while lower-skilled\nworkers were not only able to complete tasks faster but\nalso perform tasks with greater complexity, \u201cleveling up\u201d\nin their responsibilities.\n\nIndeed, advanced technologies\nare already enabling nurse practitioners to take on\nmore tasks usually performed only by primary care\nphysicians.\n\n45\n\nThe net impact of genai of inequality \u2013 the inequalityincreasing effects of benefitting those with\ncomplementary skills and the inequality-reducing\neffects of leveling the playing field among workers \u2013\nwill likely vary considerably by industry, and ultimately\ndepend on how it is developed and deployed.\n\nEffective policy management\n\nImportantly, the speed at which adoption is taking\nplace suggests governments, businesses and workers\nwill need to act swiftly to reshape education and skills\ntraining and implement fiscal policies to smooth the\ntransition for labor.\n\nSkills mismatches might be offset\nby investing in education and reskilling programs to\nensure workers are keeping pace with the new skills\ndemanded in an genai economy, while proper public\nsafeguards will be needed in cases of job displacement.\n\nA greater concentration of wealth may call for further\nredistribution of economic income; reducing inequality,\nmoreover, should help drive the demand boost that\ncreates new jobs and new incomes, promoting a\nvirtuous cycle that helps reduce inequality sustainably.\n\nIf accompanied with the right policy approach, an\neconomic boom from genai automation should be a\n\u201cwin-win\u201d that ensures all income levels stand to benefit\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\n41 \u0007 \u0007 According to BLS data, the share of the U.S. workforce represented by unions has fallen by more than half since the early 1980s, amounting to just 11.3%\nin 2022.\n\n42 \u0007 \u0007 Acemoglu and Restrepo find that automation corresponded to greater displacement effects and weaker reinstatement effects, or the acceleration of\nautomation compared to the creation of new tasks, over the last three decades than the preceding decades.\n\nSee K.

the potential economic fruits of genai are bountiful,\nthe technology brings with it several sociological and\nethical concerns that we will need to navigate and\nconfront in the coming years.\n\nChallenges include\nboth those intrinsic to the underlying technology and\nits economic implications, as well as the potential for\nmanipulation and misuse of powerful genai technologies by\nbad actors:\n\n-  \u0007 Social instability is one potential consequence of\nrapid development and deployment of genai technologies\nthat could manifest in a few ways:\n\n\u2013 \u0007 genai-generated disinformation like falsified photos\nand videos intended to deceive, otherwise known\nas \u201cdeepfakes,\u201d might soon flood the internet.\n\nSuch a development could make it even harder\nfor members of the public to discern and agree\non facts, ultimately amplifying ideological and\naffective political polarization.\n\n\u2013 The concentration of genai ownership \u0007 among a few\nlarge corporations or countries could likewise\nconcentrate power among them.\n\nAt what point do\ngenai corporations become \u201ctoo big\u201d for the greater\ngood?\n\nCompetition over such power could also\nlead to an unmitigated \u201carms race\u201d between\ncompeting genai superpowers that might have\nsecond-order consequences, including for the\ncareful assurance of safety of more powerful genai\ntechnologies.\n\n\u2013  \u0007 Economic hardship from transitional\nunemployment and increased inequality could\nencourage further political extremism.\n\n-  \u0007 Data privacy is also a major concern.\n\ngenai systems\noften require vast amounts of personal information\nto function effectively, raising concerns about the\ncollection and storage of sensitive data without\nproper consent or security measures.\n\ngenai technologies\ncan also inadvertently facilitate cross-border\ndata transfers, resulting in potential violations of\ninternational data privacy laws.\n\nFew regulations exist\nso far to ensure responsible use of both national and\ncross-border data sharing.\n\nHowever, genai is perhaps also uniquely positioned to\naddress some of the same societal challenges it could\npotentially worsen.\n\nProperly designed and trained,\ngenai may prove more objective and less biased than\nhuman counterparts.\n\nWe can imagine generative AIpowered tools that present information in ways that\nhelp ideologically opposed individuals understand\nand relate to one another, and perhaps even serve as a\nreal-time mediator or fact-checker for online discourse,\nencouraging objectivity and even social stability.\n\nMany fears around genai focus on the potential for a\n\u201cdoomsday\u201d scenario that puts all of humanity at\nrisk.\n\nAs genai systems become more autonomous and\ncapable of making decisions, many experts forecast a\nsignificant risk that humans fail to contain a powerful\ngenai system that is not aligned with our values.\n\nThis sort\nof risk, however, is a longer-term consideration that\ndepends on considerable further advancement in genai\ntechnology that could be many decades away and is\nthus beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n-  \u0007 genai bias is one key ethical concern, in that genai can\nperpetuate and amplify existing biases present in\nthe data on which it is trained.\n\nAs one old computer\nscience adage says, garbage in, garbage out .\n\nThe\nincidence of racial discrimination of facial recognition\ntechnology has been studied extensively and images\nproduced by genai evidently amplify existing\nstereotypes.\n\n46\n\n46 \u0007 \u0007 Alexandra Sasha Luccioni et al., \u201cStable Bias: Analyzing Societal Representations in Diffusion Models,\u201d ArXiv, March 20,

delivers on its promises, the implications\nshould be straightforwardly positive.\n\nOur work on LongTerm Capital Market Assumptions suggests that an\nacceleration in potential GDP growth, all else the same,\nis likely to drive an acceleration in earnings by a similar\ndegree.\n\nMoreover, a greater share of national income\nflowing to capital \u2013 the owners of genai technologies \u2013 could\ngive an added boost to equity returns.\n\nWhile these impacts could take several years to\nmaterialize, markets \u2013 and equities in particular \u2013 are\nlikely to price in genai optimism long before then.\n\nIndeed,\nstrong global equity performance in 2023 so far,\nparticularly in U.S. large caps, has been largely influenced\nby excitement around genai technologies.\n\nSuch\nperformance has inspired comparisons to the early\n2000s dot-com \u201cbubble,\u201d where enthusiasm about the\ninternet propelled blind exuberance that drove stock\nprices significantly above intrinsic values.\n\nIn our view, performance so far does not nearly\nresemble a \u201cbubble.\u201d Price multiples are not yet\nsignificantly stretched as enthusiasm has also been\naccompanied by strong upward revisions to earnings\noutlooks for stocks with the most genai exposure, and that\nmultiple expansion has been relatively broad based, in\ncontrast to the narrow leadership of the dot-com bubble\n( Exhibit 13 ).\n\nThe future potential, however, for genai to drive something\nmore like a bubble presents some upside risk\nto equities.\n\nHistorically, bubbles have commonly\ninvolved some new technology with no direct\nhistorical comparisons, making the impact hard\nto precisely quantify.\n\nWhen a consensus emerges\nthat this technology is the \u201cnext big thing,\u201d investors\u2019\nimaginations tend to run wild.\n\ngenai certainly seems\ncapable of satisfying this criterion.\n\nOn the other hand,\nmost bubbles have also developed in periods of highly\navailable credit, whereas today\u2019s environment is one of\nrestrictive monetary policy and tightening bank lending\nstandards, which should keep investors\u2019 optimism at\nleast somewhat in check.\n\nExhibit 13: Rise in valuations has so far been broad based, unlike in the early 2000s dot-com bubble\n\n12-month foward price-to-earnings (P/E) mutiple, S&P

Morgan Asset Management\nto develop and share our insights on the many questions\nsurrounding this technological wave.\n\nAs always, we\nwelcome your feedback.\n\nAn audio accompaniment of this paper is featured\non the \u201cInsights Now\u201d podcast series, available\non Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts.\n\nThe\nepisode is entitled \u201cThe economic implications of\ngenai.\u201d\n\n\ngenai excitement has already led to considerable gains for\ntechnology companies in the S&P 500.\n\nAmong individual\nequities, Big Tech \u2013 now including chipmaker Nvidia \u2013\nhas obvious exposure to genai and especially genai,\nbut as in past technology cycles, tomorrow\u2019s winners\nfrom genai may include relatively new players that are not\nin vogue today.\n\nFor our U.S. Equity Group\u2019s thinking on\nnavigating genai investment opportunities, see \u201c Artificial\nintelligence: Powering the next wave of technological\ninnovation .\u201d\n\nPotentially higher yields\n\nFor government bonds, an genai productivity shock will\nlikely contribute to modestly higher yields across\ndeveloped markets.\n\nFaster growth in productivity and\nthus real economic activity is likely to push cycle-neutral\nreal yields higher by roughly the same degree, as has\nbeen the case over the long term (especially in the\nUnited States since the middle of the 20th century).\n\nHowever, greater income inequality and downward\npressure on wages could reduce inflationary pressures\nand thus breakeven inflation rates, partially offsetting\nupward pressure on nominal yields.\n\nOne key point of\nreference is the late 1990s, the most recent period of\nstrong productivity growth; over this period, nominal\nyields did rise modestly \u2013 with the U.S. 10-year up by\nover 2% between late 1998 and early 2000, a period that\nalso roughly corresponded to the strongest NASDAQ\nappreciation.\n\nA similar dynamic may play out this time, but we are\nmindful of the possibility that greater inequality is met\nwith increased pressure to fund policies like universal\nbasic income (UBI) that are not met with greater\ntax revenues.\n\nSuch policies would result in greater\ngovernment debt issuance, which tends to result in\nhigher long-term yields.\n\nOne consequence for monetary policy is that structurally\nhigher yields could reduce the need for unconventional\npolicies like quantitative easing, which have placed\ndownward pressure on longer-dated yields.\n\n-----", "**Source** **Estimated annual genai productivity gain** **Region** **Period**\n\nAlderucci et al.\n\n6.8%* United States next 5 years\n\nBrynjolfsson et al.\n\n1.8%** United States next 10 years\n\nGoldman Sachs 1.5% (range: 0.3% to 2.9%) United States next 10 years\n\nMcKinsey 0.2% to 3.3%*** World 2023 to 2040\n\nJ.P.

attention in global media and the public square, prompting questions and discussions around this transformative technology.\n\nBusinesses, research organizations, and\neven lay users are experimenting with\ngenai, and given the excitement\nand interest, it is important to look\nmore closely at the potential capabilities\nand implications for business.\n\ngenai is a subset of artificial\nintelligence in which machines create\nnew content in the form of text, code,\nvoice, images, videos, processes, and\neven the 3D structure of proteins.\n\nSome\nforms of genai have been well\nestablished in this decade, but it was\na large language model (LLM) powering\nan easily accessible chat interface\nthat enabled genai to have its\nbreakthrough moment and surprise\neven specialists in the field.\n\nAs with other types of genai before it,\nthis new poster child of genai is stimulating\nthe imagination as organizations and\nindividuals consider how to use this tool\nto benefit both business and society.\n\ngenai can help in incremental\ndigitization and basic productivity use\ncases (e.g., more effective text-based\nchannels).\n\nBut its grander potential\nis in the higher order opportunities,\nsuch as new services or business models\nthat were previously uneconomical.\n\ngenai in general and LLMpowered chatbots in particular\nare not without risks, and this\nis prompting discussions around things\nlike the potential for job losses and\nlegal questions around intellectual\nproperty and ownership.\n\nWhat is more,\nbecause the chatbot mimics coherent\nhuman phrasing, it may give some the\nimpression that the genai understands the\nprompts to which it responds, which\ncan lead users to anthropomorphize\nthe chatbot (i.e., the ELIZA effect,\nas seen in the

applications\nto addressing climate change and\ntransforming business functions (see\nDeloitte\u2019s genai Dossier ).\n\ngenai is viewed as a\ntool that can automate skills and tasks\nperformed by humans, and genai can be so\nsuccessful in this regard that humans can\nforget skills that have been automated.\n\nExamples include writing assistants,\nhome automation, and automotive\nnavigation systems.\n\nWould most people\nhave the ability to navigate a new city\nwithout a mobile phone?\n\nWe have seen these kinds of automations\nemerge across a variety of areas and\nskillsets.\n\nThe assumed roadmap for\ngenai was that, in the shorter term, genai is\nmost valuable as a way to automate\noperational skills, and creative skills will\nremain the exclusive province of human\nthinking for the foreseeable future.\n\nWith\ngenai, this roadmap has taken an\nunexpected turn.\n\nIn late 2022, with the release of an\neasy-to-use genai chatbot, more\npeople began to discover and imagine\nhow this new technology can be used\nin the creative space.\n\nThe chatbot use\ncase opened the door for thinking more\nbroadly about how genai can\nbe used for tasks, ranging from writing\ncopy to generating 3D structures and to\noutputting organizational processes.\n\nAs\nsuch, we are now seeing the automation\nof some skills around creativity and\nimagination sooner than many expected.", "##### The evolution of genai\n\nThe ability of genai to create a convincing (albeit lowquality and greyscale) image of a human face emerged in 2014.\n\nSince then, the image quality has increased, and today, almost\nanything that can be described in words can also be generated\nas an image, using a textual description called a \u201cprompt.\u201d\nThroughout 2022, social media users tinkered with Generative\ngenai platforms and shared the results.\n\nWe have seen avocado\narmchairs and photorealistic images of astronauts riding horses\non the Moon.\n\nCosmopolitan magazine was the first to publish\na cover page created by an genai-based image generation tool,\nand there has even been a case of a user who submitted an\ngenai-generated image to a fine art competition\u2014and won first\nplace.\n\nToday, we are seeing similar improvements in other kinds\nof genai.\n\nYou may even have found this article via a chat\nwith an genai system that integrates with a search engine.\n\nImages created with genai.\n\n-----", "##### To understand how genai will impact business and life, we need to understand what\n\nit is, what it can do, and what it cannot do, yet .\n\nMachine learning has dominated the field\nof genai for decades.\n\nGenerally, this approach\nto genai development is rooted in the\nconcept of learning from examples, rather\nthan following explicitly programmed\nrules.\n\nThis is important as there are many\ntasks that humans perform based on\ntacit knowledge (and thus can provide\nexamples) but cannot describe the\nunderlying rules to do so.\n\nFor example,\nhumans know how to recognize a face,\nbut the rules that would instruct an genai\nsystem to do the same are much less\nclear.\n\nThe approach of learning from\nexamples has led to the development of\npowerful tools that can identify intricate\npatterns in complex data.\n\nIn a process referred to as training,\nthe algorithm is supplied with a large\ndataset of input/output examples to\nextract patterns from the input, which\nallow conclusions about the expected\noutput.\n\nSpam filters, for example, use\nthese patterns to identify similarities in\ndata points and relate those to different\nclasses (i.e., sorting email to a spam\nfolder).\n\nWhile the input data has become\nmore complex over time, from simple\narrays of numbers to high-resolution\nphotos, the output side of a model has\nto this point been mostly limited to\ncategories like \u201cspam\u201d or \u201cnot spam,\u201d\n\u201ccat\u201d or \u201cdog,\u201d or numerical values such\nas 7\u00b0C or

of a higher complexity.\n\nRather than just a number or a label, the\noutput can be an entire high-resolution\nimage, a full page of newly written text\n(which is generated word by word), or any\nother digital artifact.\n\nThis introduces an\ninteresting new element: There is usually\nmore than one possible correct answer.\n\nThis results in a large degree of freedom\nand variability,

such\nmodels.\n\nRunning a model also requires\na lot of compute, which is why access to\nthese kinds of models is often provided\nvia an application programming interface\n(API).\n\nThis allows developers to use the\nmodels with their existing software\nproducts without need for additional\ninfrastructure.\n\nThese models are versatile\nand can be fine-tuned for specific tasks,\nhence they are called Foundation Models.\n\nUnlike single-purpose genai, they are suited\nfor multi-purpose tasks.\n\nFigure 3:\nWith genai,\nuser prompts lead\nto artifacts that\ncan contain a large\ndegree of freedom\nand variability.\n\nOUTPUT\n\nGenerated text\n\ngenai is a broad field of computer sicence focused on\ncreating intelligent machines that can perform tasks\nthat typically require human-like congnitive abilities,\nsuch as perception, reasoning, learning, problemsolving, and decision-making.", "#### Regarding risks and limitations\n\nCurrent genai models have\nlimitations.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known\nis termed \u201challucination,\u201d which refers to\na high-confidence response that is not\ngrounded in the training data.\n\nIn other\nwords, the response is fictional.\n\nFor\nsome applications, like art generation,\nthis is a non-issue and perhaps even\na desired \u201ccreative\u201d feature of Generative\ngenai.\n\nFor other applications, however,\nsuch as copywriting or computer code\ngeneration, hallucinations can result in\nartifacts that are not entirely valid or true,\nwhich undercuts the potential value of\ngenai.\n\nAnother limiting factor is that today\u2019s\ngenai models generate artifacts\nbased on the model itself and the\ninput prompt.\n\nOther additional sources\nand datasets cannot currently be\nintegrated directly into the model\u2019s\ninternal information processing without\ncostly re-training or fine-tuning, which\nmeans genai models can only\naccess information extracted from the\ndata on which they were trained.\n\nFor\nsimilar reasons, they cannot provide\nreferences and sources for the generated\ncontent, which complicates validation.\n\nFurthermore, current models have\na context window of a few thousand\nwords, which is the limit for the size\nof the combined input and output.\n\nHowever, genai models can\nbe combined with other systems (e.g.,\nsearch, conversational genai) to leverage the\nbenefits of both parts.\n\nFor example, with\na chatbot, a conversational genai system can\nserve as an orchestration layer between\nthe genai model, a search engine,\nand the user, which helps to amplify the\nuser experience.\n\nSimilar to other genai models, Foundation\nModels can reproduce latent bias in the\ntraining data, and of course, they lack\ncomprehension and the ability to reason\nas humans do.\n\nThis has implications for\nthe broader concept of Trustworthy\ngenai\u2122 .\n\nAfter all, they are language models,\nimage models, or voice models but not\nknowledge models.", "**Some known limitations**\n\n**of current genai**\n\n**Hallucination |** genai systems create\nconfident responses that cannot be grounded in any\nof its training data.\n\n**Bias |** Similar to other learned models, Foundation\nModels inherit the bias contained in the training data.\n\n**Lack of human reasoning |** genai systems\nare based on statistical features, which is not a solid\nfoundation for logical reasoning.\n\n**Limited context window |** Current models have\na context window of a few thousand words, which is the\nlimit for the combined input and output of the model.\n\n-----", "##### Using this technology for business benefit can be conceived along two distinct approaches.\n\nFirst, the models can be used as they\nare available today, a simple interface\nthat allows near-direct access to the\nunderlying model in the form of a chat\nfor text or an image generation tool.\n\nThe second approach is to integrate\ngenai with other technologies\nto automate processes.\n\nFor example,\ngenai can allow for human-\nlevel expressive interactions, while\na conversational genai system (i.e., a chat-\nor voicebot) controls the flow and\nensures factual accuracy.\n\nAn example\nis an automated, genai-powered\ncall center.\n\nWe expect the second\napproach will provide the most value.\n\nA good start to identifying use cases\nis to find processes or tasks where\na digital artifact of some kind is created\nor processed.\n\nThis could range from\n\n\na job advertisement or a floor plan,\nall the way to the 3D model of an engine\npart, a molecule with certain properties,\nor a workflow, to name a few.\n\nUse cases\nwith high usage frequency are preferred,\nas there will be more example data to\nfine-tune and improve a model, and\nsubsequently a more substantial impact.\n\nOther factors to consider in selecting\nhigh-value use cases are existing skill and\ncost bottlenecks with human generated\nartifacts.\n\nThe quality of the artifact may\nin some cases require human effort, but\nif it can be created with genai to\na commensurate quality, then the human\ncan be liberated to work on higher quality\ntasks.\n\nBy turning lower-level creative tasks\nover to genai, we could see things\nlike databases providing stock content\n(e.g., images, sounds, or texts) turned\nupside down as these digital artifacts can\nbe created instantly with a prompt.", "##### If a task requires effort to execute but is easy\n\nto validate, it might be a good use case.\n\nDeloitte has designed a Digital Artifact\nGeneration/Validation method to help\ninnovation leaders determine whether\nan idea can be turned into a beneficial\nuse case leveraging genai.\n\nAt\nthe core of this method are two of the\nmost critical elements to consider:\nthe human effort required to complete\n\n\na task without genai; and the\nnecessary effort to validate or fact check\nthe output from the genai.\n\nThis\nleads to a two-dimensional classification,\ncategorizing use cases based on the\nrequired human effort and the ability\nof the user to validate the results.\n\n-----", "**4** **Draft a

accuracy\nor correctness of the output.\n\nThus, this\ncould be a promising application of\ngenai.\n\nYet, if the user is reviewing outputs that\nare outside of their area of expertise,\nvalidation becomes more complicated.", "**The genai output may**\n\n**read as coherent and convincingly**\n**accurate, but the potential for a**\n**\u201challucination\u201d remains.\n\n** If users lack\nthe

additional complication\nthat should be considered.\n\nIf the model\noutputs are consistently correct, users\nmay, over time, become less rigorous in\nfact checking.\n\nInevitably, however, the\nmodel will make an error, and part of the\nchallenge is that the errors may not be\nobvious, particularly when genai\nis used to create more complex things,\nlike programming code.\n\nThus, when\nassessing the ease of validation, weigh\nthe importance of ongoing attention\n\nto fact checking.\n\n-----", "##### Insights from Deloitte projects on genai: Reaping benefits from genai requires more than

images,\naudio, or video, when prompted by a user.\n\ngenai systems learn patterns and relationships\nfrom massive amounts of data, which enables them to generate new content that may be similar, but\nnot identical, to the underlying training data.\n\nThe systems generally require a user to submit prompts\nthat guide the generation of new content.\n\n(Adapted slightly from U.S. Government

the basis for the guidelines in this document.\n\nA foundational part of the NIST genai Risk\nFramework is to ensure the trustworthiness of systems that use genai.\n\nThe guiding principles are:\n\n-  **Safe, secure, and resilient:** genai should be used with safety and security in mind, minimizing\npotential harm and ensuring that systems are reliable, resilient, and controllable by humans.\n\ngenai\nsystems used by state agencies should not endanger human life, health, property, or the\nenvironment.\n\n-  **Valid and reliable:** Agencies should ensure genai use produces accurate and valid outputs and\ndemonstrates the reliability of system performance.\n\n-----\n\n-  **Fairness, inclusion, and non-discrimination:** genai applications must be developed and utilized\nto support and uplift communities, particularly those historically marginalized.\n\nFairness in genai\nincludes concerns for equality and equity by addressing issues such as harmful bias and\ndiscrimination 1 .\n\n-  **Privacy and data protection:** genai should be used to respect user privacy, ensure data\nprotection, and comply with relevant privacy regulations and standards.\n\nPrivacy values such\nas anonymity, confidentiality, and control generally should guide choices for genai system design,\ndevelopment, and deployment.\n\nPrivacy-enhancing genai should safeguard human autonomy and\nidentity where appropriate.\n\n-  **Accountability and responsibility:** As public stewards, agencies should use genai\nresponsibly and be held accountable for the performance, impact, and consequences of its\nuse in agency work.\n\n-  **Transparency and auditability:** Acting transparently and creating a record of genai processes\ncan build trust and foster collective learning.\n\nTransparency reflects the extent to which\ninformation about an genai system and its outputs is available to the individuals interacting with\nthe system.\n\nTransparency answers \u201cwhat happened\u201d in the system.\n\n-  **Explainable and interpretable:** Agencies should ensure genai use in the system can be\nexplained, meaning \u201chow\u201d the decision was made by the system can be understood.\n\nInterpretability of a system means an agency can answer the \u201cwhy\u201d for a decision made by the\nsystem, and its meaning or context to the user.\n\n-  **Public purpose and social benefit:** The use of genai should support the state\u2019s work in\ndelivering better and more equitable services and outcomes to its residents.", "## Guidelines\n\nFact-checking, Bias Reduction, and Review\n\nAll content generated by genai should be reviewed and fact-checked, especially if used in public\ncommunication or decision-making.\n\nState personnel generating content with genai systems should verify\nthat the content does not contain inaccurate or outdated information and potentially harmful or\noffensive material.\n\nGiven that genai systems may reflect biases in their training data or processing\nalgorithms, state personnel should also review and edit genai-generated content to reduce potential\nbiases.\n\nWhen consuming genai-generated content, be mindful of the potential biases and inaccuracies that may\nbe present.\n\nDisclosure and Attribution\n\ngenai-generated content used in official state capacity should be clearly labeled as such, and details of its\nreview and editing process (how the material was reviewed, edited, and by whom) should be\nprovided.\n\nThis allows for transparent authorship and responsible content evaluation.\n\n1 NIST has identified three major categories of genai bias to be considered and managed: systemic, computational and\nstatistical, and human-cognitive.\n\nSee NIST genai Risk Framework .\n\n-----\n\n-  Sample disclosure line: This memo was summarized by Google Bard using\nthe following prompt: \u201cSummarize the following memo: (memo content)\u201d.\n\nThe summary was reviewed and edited by [insert name(s)].\n\n-  Sample disclosure line: (In the file header comments section) This code\nwas written with the assistance of ChatGPT3.5.\n\nThe initial code was\ncreated using the following prompt: \u201cWrite HTML code for an Index.HTML\npage that says, \u2018Hello World\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe code was then modified, reviewed, and\ntested by the web development team at WaTech.\n\nAdditionally, state personnel should conduct due diligence to ensure no copyrighted material is\npublished without appropriate attribution or the acquisition of necessary rights.\n\nThis includes content\ngenerated by genai systems, which could inadvertently infringe upon existing copyrights.\n\nSensitive or Confidential Data\n\nAgencies are strongly advised not to integrate, enter, or otherwise incorporate any non-public data\n(non-Category 1 data) or information into publicly accessible genai systems (e.g., ChatGPT).\n\nThe use of such data could lead to unauthorized disclosures, legal liabilities, and other consequences\n(see \u201cCompliance with Policies and Regulations\u201d section below).\n\nIf your agency has a usage scenario that requires non-public data to be used with genai\ntechnology, contact your agency privacy/security team, or the Office of Privacy and Data Protection\nfor assistance at  .\n\nSimilarly, where non-public data is involved, agencies should not acquire genai services, enter\ninto service agreements with genai vendors, or use open-source genai generative technology\nunless they have undergone a Security Design Review and received prior written authorization from\nthe relevant authority, which may include a data sharing contract.\n\nContact your agency\u2019s Privacy and\nSecurity Officers to provide further guidance.", "**For Local Governments**\n\n\u201cLocal government\u201d means governmental entities other than the state and federal agencies.\n\nIt\nincludes, but is not limited to cities, counties, school districts, and special purpose districts (i.e., Public\nUtility Districts).\n\nWe advise that local government agencies in Washington state engage their legal, privacy, or records\nspecialists to validate any policy or regulation that may be in scope for their respective entity as it\npertains to any handling of confidential data.\n\nCompliance with Policies and Regulations\n\nState law already restricts the sharing of confidential information with unauthorized third parties.\n\nFor\nstate employees, RCW 42.52.050 (the state\u2019s ethics law) specifically states: \u201cNo state officer or state\nemployee may disclose confidential information to any person not entitled or authorized to receive the\ninformation.\u201d The definition of \u201cperson\u201d in the state ethics law means \u201cany individual, partnership,\nassociation, corporation, firm, institution, or other entity, whether or not operated for profit.\u201d This\ndefinition would include commercial genai tools freely available in the market.\n\nAdditionally, be aware that using a genai system may result in creating a public record under\nWashington state's Public Records Act.\n\nContact your agency\u2019s Privacy and Records Officers for more\ninformation.\n\n-----\n\nCollaboration\n\nUsers of genai for state and local government use should consider joining the state\u2019s genai\nCommunity of Practice (genai CoP) and contributing usage scenarios and best practices in your\norganization to foster collective learning.\n\nAfter receiving approval from your technology leadership that\nyou are authorized to represent your organization in this community, please contact Nick Stowe\n(  ) or Katy Ruckle (  ) to join the genai CoP.\n\nTechnology leaders across the state are encouraged to lead best practice implementation for their\nagency\u2019s use of genai and should be staying aware of and maintaining a list of their agencies\nuse and use cases of genai.", "## genai Usage Scenarios and Dos and Don\u2019ts\n\nBelow are several usage scenarios alongside some do\u2019s (best practices) and don\u2019ts (things to avoid):\n\n-  Rewrite documents in plain language for better accessibility and understandability.\n\n`o` **Do** specify the reading level in the prompt, use readability apps to ensure the text is\n\neasily understandable and matches the intended reading level, and review the\nrewritten documents for biases and inaccuracies.\n\n`o` **Don\u2019t** include sensitive or confidential information in the prompt.\n\n-  Condense longer documents and summarize text.\n\n`o` **Do** read the entire document independently and review the summary for biases and\ninaccuracies.\n\n`o` **Don\u2019t** include sensitive or confidential information in the prompt.\n\n-  Draft documents.\n\n`o` **Do** edit and review the document, label the content appropriately (see \u201cdisclosure and\nattribution\u201d above), and remember that you and the state of Washington are\nresponsible and accountable for the impact and consequences of the generated\ncontent.\n\n`o` **Don\u2019t** include sensitive or confidential information in the prompt or use genai to\ndraft communication materials on sensitive topics that require a human touch.\n\n-  Aid in coding.\n\n`o` **Do** understand what the code is doing before deploying it in a production environment,\nunderstand the use of libraries and dependencies, and develop familiarity with\nvulnerabilities and other security considerations associated with the code.\n\n`o` **Don\u2019t** include sensitive or confidential information (including passwords, keys,\nproprietary information, etc.)\n\nin the prompt and code.\n\n-  Aid in generating image, audio, and video content for more effective communication.\n\n`o` **Do** review generated content for biases and inaccuracies and engage with your\ncommunication department before using genai-generated audiovisual content for public\nconsumption.\n\n`o` **Don\u2019t** include sensitive or confidential information in the prompt.\n\n-----\n\n-  Automate responses to frequently asked questions from residents (e.g., in resident support\nchatbots).\n\n`o` **Do** implement robust measures to protect resident data.\n\n`o` **Don't** use genai as a substitute for human interaction or assume it will perfectly\nunderstand residents\u2019 queries.\n\nProvide mechanisms for residents to easily escalate\ntheir concerns or seek human assistance if the genai system cannot address their needs\neffectively.", "## Use Cases\n\nThe genai Community of Practice will be discussing use cases for genai through the\nsubcommittee process.\n\nPotential uses cases of \u201csafe genai\u201d by the state include may include\ncybersecurity scans, environmental assessments (e.g.\n\nsea grass videos by DNR), and chatbots to\nmore effectively answer questions about state agency services."]

committed an act of academic dishonesty,\nwill, within five business days of discovering evidence of academic dishonesty, inform the\nstudent of the allegation and evidence in person, by phone, or by email.\n\nThe faculty will at the\nsame time inform the department chair or program director.\n\nThe faculty member will initiate a\nmeeting with the student and may include a third party, typically the department chair or\nprogram director or designee to present the evidence.\n\nThis meeting will take place as soon as\npossible following student notification of the allegation (see Appendix for definition of terms\nincluding \u201cnotification,\u201d and timelines).\n\nIf the instructor is the department chair or program\ndirector, the dean or designee will refer the case to the chair or program director of a closely\nrelated department.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for the faculty\nmember to present and discuss the evidence with the student and the circumstances that led to the\nfaculty member\u2019s concerns or allegation of an academic integrity violation.\n\nThe meeting also\nprovides an opportunity for the student to ask questions to clarify the nature of the violation and\nthe penalties that may be imposed.\n\nIf the student is unable or unwilling to confer, the faculty\nmember may, after making reasonable attempts to confer, proceed with the process of reporting\nthe violation and determining penalties.\n\nIf the faculty member then determines that the student committed an act of academic dishonesty,\ns/he will determine the appropriate penalties and will fill out the Academic Integrity Violation\nReport form.\n\nThis form, along with all supporting material, will be forwarded to the dean's\ndesignee of the college or school in which the course is offered and to the chair or program\ndirector of the department in which the course is offered within ten business days of the studentfaculty meeting.\n\nA copy of the Academic Integrity Violation Report form and all supporting material are given to\nthe student in person or via email at the same time it is delivered to the dean\u2019s designee and\ndepartment chair or program director.\n\nA copy of the form will be sent via certified mail by the\ndean\u2019s designee to the student\u2019s address of record.\n\nThe dean's designee will review the report and\nthe student's record and may implement further penalties, as may be appropriate depending on\nthe seriousness of the violation.\n\nThe dean's designee will forward copies of the report and the supporting materials to the Office\nof the Provost.\n\nThe Office of the Provost will keep the report on file and will maintain a file of\ncases of violations of the Academic Integrity Policy.\n\nIn cases of multiple violations, the Office of\nthe Provost will notify the dean's designee in the school in which the student is a major and other\nacademic officials if appropriate.", "**IV.\n\nPenalties**\n\nA

distinct from the Microsoft 365 Copilot service, which currently has limited availability at IU.\n\nSince 2020, there has been an exponential increase in the investment and development of generative artificial\nintelligence (genai) services.\n\ngenai is a type of genai system that generates new text, images, or\nother media in response to prompts.\n\nNotable genai systems include ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google\nBard.", "## Precautions\n\ngenai has potential applications across a wide range of industries, including art, writing, and software\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, there are also concerns about the potential misuse of these tools and any data shared with the\nservices.\n\nWhen you provide information to these tools, such as queries, student essays, grant proposals, source code, or\ndatasets, it is the same as posting the information on a public website.\n\nIndiana University encourages its affiliates to experiment with using these genai services, as long as no\ninstitutional data is submitted to them without approval.\n\nAt IU, Microsoft Copilot \ue164 ( (formerly Bing Chat Enterprise) is\n\navailable for use by IU faculty and staff, and it is the recommended way to use genai within the IU environment.\n\nAs part of the university's enterprise agreement with Microsoft, Copilot is approved to interact with data classified up to\nand including University-Internal data \ue164 (\n\ndata.html).\n\nTo use Copilot, you must be logged in with your Microsoft 365 at IU \ue164 (\n\nwhr=iu.edu) account (your `@iu.edu` email address and your IU passphrase (acpu)).\n\nFor information about browser and\napp compatibility, see About Bing Chat Enterprise/Copilot at IU (bing).\n\nTo date, no other genai tools have been approved for data beyond Public classification, and these have not been\nthrough the Software and Services Selection Process (SSSP).\n\nPrior to the sharing of any institutional data, these\nservices will need to go through review to ensure the necessary contracts and safeguards are in place to protect the\ndata submitted and to ensure the algorithms in use are ethical, transparent, and beneficial to the IU community.\n\nSkip to content\n\n\nTypes of institutional data that should not be submitted to public versions of genai tools, even when\nanonymized Skip to search , include:\n\n\nanonymized Skip to search\n\n\n-----\n\n(\n\nAny data that may be considered student, faculty, or staff intellectual property, unless the individual submitting\nthat intellectual property created it\n\nSpecific examples that are not appropriate for the public versions of genai tools include:\n\nSharing names and information about a real student, employee, research participant, or patient\n\nAsking an genai service to summarize and grade a student paper or assignment\n\nSharing employee-related data such as performance or benefit information for communication drafting or analysis\n\nAsking an genai service to generate code for IU systems protecting institutional data or sharing IU source code for\n\nediting\n\nSharing grant proposals still under review", "## Acceptable uses\n\nWith these precautions in mind, there are numerous ways to use genai tools without submitting university data\nor intellectual property.\n\nUsing general queries to generate content to pull information from the genai resources is a good\nway to engage with the products.\n\nStudents should use genai in ways that align with university academic integrity policies and communicate with\ntheir instructors before using genai in their coursework.\n\nSchools and departments may elect to further restrict\ngenai.\n\nFrom a data management perspective, examples of acceptable uses of genai include:\n\nSyllabus and lesson planning: Instructors can use genai to help outline course syllabi and lesson plans,\ngetting suggestions for learning objectives, teaching strategies, and assessment methods.\n\nCourse materials that\nthe instructor has authored (such as course notes) may be submitted by the instructor.\n\nCorrespondence when no student or employee information is provided: Students, faculty, or staff may use\nfake information (such as an invented name for the recipient of an email message) to generate drafts of\ncorrespondence using genai tools, as long as they are using general queries and do not include institutional data.\n\nProfessional development and training presentations: Faculty and staff can use genai to draft materials for\n\npotential professional development opportunities, including

brings tremendous potential to transform education at all levels.\n\nBy enabling\nmore efficient, universal, and deeper learning, genai can unlock new realms of knowledge that were\npreviously unimaginable.\n\nThis emerging technology promises to catalyze business innovation and\neconomic growth for the Commonwealth.\n\nHowever, genai also poses risks that must be carefully managed.\n\nAs we integrate these powerful tools into\nour schools and workplaces, we must urgently equip students and workers with the skills, knowledge,\nand competencies to harness genai responsibly and effectively.\n\nOur education system must adapt to\nprepare a workforce that can leverage genai to its full potential while safeguarding against its risks.\n\nWhile genai tools can analyze information and enhance certain aspects of learning with unmatched\nefficiency, we must remember that education is ultimately a human endeavor.\n\nThe true art of teaching\ninvolves wisdom, judgment and interpersonal skills that machines cannot replicate.\n\nAs such, genai should\nnever fully replace teachers, who nurture students\u2019 critical thinking, values and character development.\n\nVirginia is well-positioned for this new era.\n\nThe most critical national security and military intelligence\ninstitutions in the United States are headquartered in Virginia and the Commonwealth\u2019s colleges and\nuniversities lead the nation in technology research and development.\n\nThese unique factors provide\nVirginia with a responsibility to spearhead a policy environment that strengthens trust, safety, and\nsecurity in the development and deployment of genai technologies and the opportunity to assemble\nexperts from the workplace and education to provide ongoing guidance and assistance in the\nresponsible and effective implementation of genai in our education, training, and workplace learning.", "**1.\n\nGuiding Principles for the Use of genai in Education**\n\n-  **Do no harm:** All integration of genai in education must be in accordance with the policy and IT\nstandards that are set forth in the Executive Order and in other state and federal policies.\n\nThis\nincludes ensuring the safeguarding of the privacy, security, and confidentiality of personally\nidentifiable information, ensuring that algorithms are not based on inherent biases that lead to\ndiscriminatory outcomes, and that genai is only allowed when its use has the potential to contribute\npositive good/improvement to the status quo.\n\n-----\n\n-  **Prioritize integrity:** A core purpose of education is the development of responsible, ethical, and\nengaged citizens.\n\nTherefore, part of the integration of genai in education must be to teach about\nmorality, ethics, honor, cheating, and how genai can lead to perverse and\ndestructive outcomes for individuals, relationships, and communities.\n\n-  **Augment, not replace humans:** genai cannot and should not ever replace human\njudgement.\n\nAlthough synthesis and analysis of information can be expedited through genai, it will\nnever replace teachers who provide wisdom, context, feedback, empathy, nurturing and\nhumanity in ways that a machine cannot.\n\nIt also should not overpower/over-ride the critical\nthinking, judgement, and morality of the learner.\n\n-  **Harness genai to empower student success:** genai presents transformative opportunities to enrich\ninstruction and enable more adaptive, personalized learning.\n\nTo fully leverage these benefits, we\nmust embrace an outlook of innovation and experimentation, while ensuring access for all\nlearners.\n\nRather than just digitizing traditional practices, we can reimagine education to nurture\neach student\u2019s unlimited potential with the assistive power of genai.\n\nOur vision should focus on\npossibility - genai as a gateway to expand human capacity - not conformity to conventions of the\npast.\n\n-  **Work in partnership:** genai researchers and experts in Virginia colleges and universities and\nemployers are key partners and guides around building the skills and knowledge required to be\nsuccessful in the new economy.\n\nThis includes how to think about evolving genai systems and the\npractices needed to use them responsibly.\n\n-  **Be constantly discerning and responsive to the continuous expansion of genai capabilities and**\n**uses:** This is not a one-and-done.\n\nThe guidelines, best practices, and tools available will\nconstantly need to be revisited to keep pace with the changes brought by the exponential\ngrowth of genai and technology advancements in our world.\n\nNimbleness and urgency, balanced\nwith careful considerations, will be critical to ensuring we are as prepared for the continuous\nchange ahead in education.", "**2.\n\nStrategies for Successful Integration of genai in Education**\n\nAt every level of education\u2014from governing boards to individual classrooms\u2014these strategies can\nimprove the effective integration of genai into education.\n\n_Encourage Exploration_ \u2014 To have informed discussions about integrating genai, educators first need handson experience to understand these technologies\u2019 capabilities and limitations.\n\nSchool leaders should\nactively facilitate opportunities for teacher teams to directly explore various genai tools.\n\nThrough guided\nfirsthand usage, educators can discover potential applications to enrich instruction, as well as critical\nrisks and challenges to consider.\n\nRather than rely on rumors or superficial perceptions, we must\nempower teachers with deeper practical knowledge.\n\nBy allocating time and resources for structured\nexperimentation, schools can tap into educators\u2019 insights to uncover creative use cases while proactively\naddressing ethical concerns.\n\nThis ground-up understanding, straight from classroom trenches, will\nproduce more thoughtful and responsible approaches to adopting genai.\n\n1.\n\n_Provide Professional Development_ \u2014 As with any new tool or strategy, educators need\n\nprofessional development from experts in order to feel comfortable using it.\n\nOffering workshops\nor professional development courses, micro-credentials, or micro-badges on genai as well as\nmeaningful follow-up implementation and application activities ,discussions and opportunities to\n\n\n-----\n\ncollaborate with colleagues and experts who can help teachers understand and experience its\ncapabilities and limitations.\n\ncan help teachers understand and experience its capabilities and\nlimitations.\n\n2.\n\n_Spotlight Success_ \u2014 Spotlight interesting examples of genai that are already being used in schools.\n\nEnsure educators have meaningful outlets to share what they are trying and whether it is\nworking or not.\n\nEncourage teachers to collaborate in their exploration of genai to learn from each\nother's experiences and builds a supportive community for this new educational environment.\n\n3.\n\n_Host Stakeholder Conversations_ \u2014 Host regular conversations with business leaders, educators,\n\ngoverning members, leaders, and families about genai and how schools are preparing or will be\npreparing students with the skills to thrive in an genai-infused world.\n\nTopics could include, but not\nlimited to, fostering ethical genai use and digital citizenship collaboration and interdisciplinary\nlearning, and integration of genai in the curriculum.\n\n4.\n\n_Set The Right Conditions_ \u2014 When it comes to using genai or any other technologies in school, it is\n\nimportant to establish conditions for effective use.\n\nClearly outline the school or system\u2019s policies\nand protocols around data privacy, honor code, student code of conduct, acceptable use, and\nethical considerations when using genai, including those related to plagiarism and proper use of\nsecondary sources.\n\nTeachers should know what is expected of them and the boundaries within\nwhich they should operate.\n\nThese conditions might include using technology to support

priorities that would be safe, effective, and\n\nscalable.\n\nNaturally, educators wonder if the rapid advances in technology in everyday lives could\n\nhelp.\n\nLike all of us, educators use genai-powered services in their everyday lives, such as voice\n\nassistants in their homes; tools that can correct grammar, complete sentences, and write essays;\n\nand automated trip planning on their phones.\n\nMany educators are actively exploring genai tools as\n\nthey are newly released to the public 1 .\n\nEducators see opportunities to use genai-powered capabilities\n\nlike speech recognition to increase the support available to students with disabilities, multilingual\n\nlearners, and others who could benefit from greater adaptivity and personalization in digital\n\ntools for learning.\n\nThey are exploring how genai can enable writing or improving lessons, as well as\n\ntheir process for finding, choosing, and adapting material for use in their lessons.\n\nEducators are also aware of new risks.\n\nUseful, powerful functionality can also be accompanied\n\nwith new data privacy and security risks.\n\nEducators recognize that genai can automatically produce\n\noutput that is inappropriate or wrong.\n\nThey are wary that the associations or automations\n\ncreated by genai may amplify unwanted biases.\n\nThey have noted new ways in which students may\n\n1 Walton Family Foundation (March 1, 2023).\n\nTeachers and students embrace ChatGPT for education.\n\n-----\n\nrepresent others\u2019 work as their own.\n\nThey are well-aware of \u201cteachable moments\u201d and\n\npedagogical strategies that a human teacher can address but are undetected or misunderstood by\n\ngenai models.\n\nThey worry whether recommendations suggested by an algorithm would be fair.\n\nEducators\u2019 concerns are manifold.\n\nEveryone in education has a responsibility to harness the\n\ngood to serve educational priorities while also protecting against the dangers that may arise as a\n\nresult of genai being integrated in edtech.\n\nTo develop guidance for edtech, the Department works closely with educational constituents.\n\nThese constituents include educational leaders\u2014teachers, faculty, support staff, and other\n\neducators\u2014researchers; policymakers; advocates and funders; technology developers;\n\ncommunity members and organizations; and, above all, learners and their families/caregivers.\n\nRecently, through its activities with constituents, the Department noticed a sharp rise in interest\n\nand concern about genai.\n\nFor example, a 2021 field scan found that developers of all kinds of\n\ntechnology systems\u2014for student information, classroom instruction, school logistics, parent-\n\nteacher communication, and more\u2014expect to add genai capabilities to their systems.\n\nThrough a\n\nseries of four listening sessions conducted in June and August 2022 and attended by more than\n\n700 attendees, it became clear that constituents believe that action is required now in order to get\n\nahead of the expected increase of genai in education technology\u2014and they want to roll up their\n\nsleeves and start working together.\n\nIn late 2022 and early 2023, the public became aware of new\n\ngenai chatbots and began to explore how genai could be used to write essays, create lesson\n\nplans, produce images, create personalized assignments for students, and more.\n\nFrom public\n\nexpression in social media, at conferences, and in news media, the Department learned more\n\nabout risks and benefits of genai-enabled chatbots.\n\nAnd yet this report will not focus on a specific genai\n\ntool, service, or announcement, because genai-enabled systems evolve rapidly.\n\nFinally, the\n\nDepartment engaged the educational policy expertise available internally and in its relationships\n\nwith genai policy experts to shape the findings and recommendations in this report.", "##### Three Reasons to Address genai in Education Now\n\n\u201cI strongly believe in the need for stakeholders to understand the cyclical effects of genai and education.\n\nBy understanding how different activities accrue, we have the ability to support virtuous cycles.\n\nOtherwise, we will likely allow vicious cycles to perpetuate.\u201d  \u2014Lydia Liu\n\nDuring the listening sessions, constituents articulated three reasons to address genai now:\n\nFirst, genai may enable achieving educational priorities in better ways, at scale, and with lower costs.\n\nAddressing varied unfinished learning of students due to the pandemic is a policy priority, and\n\ngenai may improve the adaptivity of learning resources to students\u2019 strengths and needs.\n\nImproving\n\nteaching jobs is a priority, and via automated assistants or other tools, genai may provide teachers\n\ngreater support.\n\ngenai may also enable teachers to extend the support they offer to individual\n\nstudents when they run out of time.\n\nDeveloping resources that are responsive to the knowledge\n\nand experiences students bring to their learning\u2014their community and cultural assets\u2014is a\n\npriority, and genai may enable greater customizability of curricular resources to meet local needs.\n\n-----\n\nAs seen in voice assistants, mapping tools, shopping recommendations, essay-writing capabilities,\n\nand other familiar applications, genai may enhance educational services.\n\nSecond, urgency and importance arise through awareness of system-level risks and anxiety about\n\npotential future risks.\n\nFor example, students may become subject to greater surveillance.\n\nSome\n\nteachers worry that they may be replaced\u2014to the contrary, the Department firmly rejects the\n\nidea that genai could replace teachers.\n\nExamples of discrimination from algorithmic bias are on the\n\npublic\u2019s mind, such as a voice recognition system that doesn\u2019t work as well with regional dialects,\n\nor an exam monitoring system that may unfairly identify some groups of students for\n\ndisciplinary action.\n\nSome uses of genai may be infrastructural and invisible, which creates concerns\n\nabout transparency and trust.\n\ngenai often arrives in new applications with the aura of magic, but\n\neducators and procurement policies require that edtech show efficacy.\n\ngenai may provide\n\ninformation that appears authentic, but actually is inaccurate or lacking a basis in reality.\n\nOf the\n\nhighest importance, genai brings new risks in addition to the well-known data privacy and data\n\nsecurity risks, such as the risk of scaling pattern detectors and automations that result in\n\n\u201calgorithmic discrimination\u201d (e.g., systematic unfairness in the learning opportunities or\n\nresources recommended to some populations of students).\n\nThird, urgency arises because of the scale of possible unintended or unexpected consequences.\n\nWhen genai enables instructional decisions to be automated at scale, educators may discover\n\nunwanted consequences.\n\nIn a simple example, if genai adapts by speeding curricular pace for some\n\nstudents and by slowing the pace for other students (based on incomplete data, poor theories, or\n\nbiased assumptions about learning), achievement gaps could widen.\n\nIn some cases, the quality of\n\navailable data may produce unexpected results.\n\nFor example, an genai-enabled teacher hiring\n\nsystem might be assumed to be more objective than human-based r\u00e9sum\u00e9 scoring.\n\nYet, if the genai\n\nsystem relies on poor quality historical data, it might de-prioritize candidates who could bring\n\nboth diversity and talent to a school\u2019s teaching workforce.\n\nIn summary, it is imperative to address genai in education _now_ to realize key opportunities, prevent\n\nand mitigate emergent risks, and tackle unintended consequences.", "##### Toward Policies for genai in Education\n\nThe 2023 genai Index Report from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered genai has documented\n\nnotable acceleration of investment in genai as well as an increase of research on ethics, including\n\nissues of fairness and transparency.\n\n2 Of course, research on topics like ethics is increasing\n\nbecause problems are observed.\n\nEthical problems will occur in education, too.\n\n3 The report found\n\na striking interest in 25 countries in the number of legislative proposals that specifically include\n\ngenai.\n\nIn the United States, multiple executive orders are focused on ensuring genai is trustworthy and\n\nequitable, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has introduced a\n\n2 Maslej, N., Fattorini, L., Brynjolfsson E., Etchemendy, J.,

that require a national policy response.\n\nIn\n\naddition to broad policies for all sectors of society, education-specific policies are needed to\n\naddress new opportunities and challenges within existing frameworks that take into\n\nconsideration federal student privacy laws (such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy\n\nAct , or FERPA), as well as similar state related laws.\n\ngenai also makes recommendations and takes\n\nactions automatically in support of student learning, and thus educators will need to consider\n\nhow such recommendations and actions can comply with laws such as the Individuals with\n\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA).\n\nWe discuss specific policies in the concluding section.", "**Figure 1: Research about genai is growing rapidly.\n\nOther indicators,

genai.\n\nListening session\n\nparticipants called for building on these concepts and frameworks but also recognized the need\n\nto do more; participants noted a pressing need for guardrails and guidelines that make\n\neducational use of genai advances safe, especially given this accelerating pace of incorporation of genai\n\ninto mainstream technologies.\n\nAs policy development takes time, policy makers and educational\n\nconstituents together need to start now to specify the requirements, disclosures, regulations, and\n\nother structures that can shape a positive and safe future for

aim to build on the listening sessions the Department hosted to engage and\n\ninform all constituents involved in making educational decisions so they can prepare for and\n\nmake better decisions about the role of genai in teaching and learning.\n\ngenai is a complex and broad\n\ntopic, and we are not able to cover everything nor resolve issues that still require more\n\nconstituent engagement.\n\nThis report is intended to be a starting point.\n\nThe opportunities and issues of genai in education are equally important in K-12, higher education,\n\nand workforce learning.\n\nDue to scope limitations, the examples in this report will focus on K-12\n\neducation.\n\nThe implications are similar at all levels of education, and the Department intends\n\nfurther activities in 2023 to engage constituents beyond K-12 schools.", "##### Guiding Questions\n\nUnderstanding that genai increases automation and allows machines to do some tasks that only\n\npeople did in the past leads us to a pair of bold, overarching questions:\n\n1.\n\nWhat is our collective vision of a desirable and achievable educational system that\n\nleverages automation to advance learning while protecting and centering human agency?\n\n2.\n\nHow and on what timeline will we be ready with necessary guidelines and guardrails, as\n\nwell as convincing evidence of positive impacts, so that constituents can ethically and\n\nequitably implement this vision widely?\n\nIn the Learning, Teaching, and Assessment sections of this report, we elaborate on elements of\n\nan educational vision grounded in what today\u2019s learners, teachers, and educational systems need,\n\nand we describe key insights and next steps required.\n\nBelow, we articulate four key foundations\n\nfor framing these themes.\n\nThese foundations arise from what we know about the effective use of\n\neducational technology to improve opportunity, equity, and outcomes for students and also\n\nrelate to the new Blueprint.", "##### Foundation 1: Center People (Parents, Educators, and Students)\n\nEducation-focused genai policies at the federal, state, and district levels will be needed to guide and\n\nempower local and individual decisions about which technologies to adopt and use in schools\n\nand classrooms.\n\nConsider what is happening in everyday lives.\n\nMany of us use genai-enabled\n\nproducts because they are often better and more convenient.\n\nFor example, few people want to\n\nuse paper maps anymore; people find that technology helps us plan the best route to a\n\ndestination more efficiently and conveniently.\n\nAnd yet, people often do not realize how much\n\nprivacy they are giving up when they accept genai-enabled systems into their lives.\n\ngenai will bring\n\nprivacy and other risks that are hard to address only via individual decision making; additional\n\nprotections will be needed.\n\n-----", "##### There should be clear limits on the ability to collect, use, transfer, and maintain our personal data, including limits on targeted advertising.\n\nThese limits should put the burden on platforms to minimize how much information they collect, rather than burdening Americans with reading fine print.\n\n8\n\nAs protections are developed, we recommend that policies center people, not machines.\n\nTo this\n\nend, a first recommendation in this document (in the next section) is an emphasis on **genai with**\n\n**humans in the loop** .\n\nTeachers, learners, and others need to retain their agency to decide what\n\npatterns mean and to choose courses of action.\n\nThe idea of humans in the loop builds on the\n\nconcept of \u201cHuman Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback\u201d in the Blueprint and ethical\n\nconcepts used more broadly in evaluating genai, such as preserving human dignity.\n\nA top policy\n\npriority must be establishing human in the loop as a requirement in educational applications,\n\ndespite contrary pressures to

on what we do now.\u201d  \u2014Dr.\n\nRussell Shilling\n\nA recent Executive Order 9 issued by President Biden sought to strengthen the connection among\n\nracial equity, education and genai, stating that \u201cmembers of underserved communities\u2014many of\n\nwhom have endured generations of discrimination and disinvestment\u2014still confront significant\n\nbarriers to realizing the full

as described in the Department\u2019s recent report, _Advancing Digital Equity for_\n\n_All_ 10 is essential to policy discussion about genai in education.\n\nThis report defines digital equity

United States.\u201d\n\nIssues related to racial equity and unfair bias were at the heart of every listening session we held.\n\nIn particular, we heard a conversation that was increasingly attuned to issues of data quality and\n\nthe consequences of using poor or inappropriate data in genai systems for education.\n\nDatasets are\n\nused to develop genai, and when they are non-representative or contain undesired associations or\n\npatterns, resulting genai models may act unfairly in how they detect patterns or automate decisions.\n\nSystematic, unwanted unfairness in how a computer detects patterns or automates decisions is\n\ncalled \u201calgorithmic bias.\u201d Algorithmic bias could diminish equity at scale with unintended\n\ndiscrimination.\n\nAs this document discussed in the _Formative Assessment_ section, this is not a new\n\nconversation.\n\nFor decades, constituents have rightly probed whether assessments are unbiased\n\nand fair.\n\nJust as with assessments, whether an genai model exhibits algorithmic bias or is judged to\n\nbe fair and trustworthy is critical as local school leaders make adoption decisions about using genai\n\nto achieve their equity goals.\n\nWe highlight the concept of \u201calgorithmic discrimination\u201d in the Blueprint.\n\nBias is intrinsic to\n\nhow genai algorithms are developed using historical data, and it can be difficult to anticipate all\n\nimpacts of biased data and algorithms during system design.\n\nThe Department holds that biases\n\nin genai algorithms must be addressed when they introduce or sustain unjust discriminatory\n\npractices in education.\n\nFor example, in postsecondary education, algorithms that make\n\nenrollment decisions, identify students for early intervention, or flag possible student cheating\n\non exams must be interrogated for evidence of unfair discriminatory bias\u2014and not only when\n\nsystems are designed, but also later, as systems become widely used.", "##### Foundation 3: Ensure Safety, Ethics, and Effectiveness\n\nA central safety argument in the Department\u2019s policies is the need for data privacy and security\nin the systems used by teachers, students, and others in educational institutions.\n\nThe\ndevelopment and deployment of genai requires access to detailed data.\n\nThis data goes beyond\nconventional student records (roster and gradebook information) to detailed information about\nwhat students do as they learn with technology and what teachers do as they use technology to\nteach.\n\ngenai\u2019s dependence on data requires renewed and strengthened attention to data privacy,\nsecurity, and governance (as also indicated in the Blueprint).\n\nAs genai models are not generally\ndeveloped in consideration of educational usage or student privacy, the educational application\nof these models may not be aligned with the educational institution\u2019s efforts to comply with\nfederal student privacy laws, such as FERPA, or state privacy laws.\n\n-----", "**Figure 2: The Elementary and Secondary Education Act defines four levels of evidence.\n\n**\n\nFurther, educational leaders are committed to basing their decisions about the adoption of\neducational technology on evidence of effectiveness\u2014a central foundation of the Department\u2019s\npolicy.\n\nFor example, the requirement to base decisions on evidence also arises in the Elementary\nand Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended, which introduced four tiers of evidence (see\nFigure 2).\n\nOur nation\u2019s research agencies, including the Institute of Education Sciences, are\nessential to producing the needed evidence.\n\nThe Blueprint calls for evidence of effectiveness, but\nthe education sector is ahead of that game: we need to insist that genai-enhanced edtech rises to\nmeet ESEA standards as well.", "##### Foundation 4: Promote Transparency\n\nThe central role of complex genai models in a technology\u2019s detection of patterns and\n\nimplementation of automation is an important way in which genai-enabled applications, products,\n\nand services will be different from conventional edtech.\n\nThe Blueprint introduces the need for\n\ntransparency about genai models in terms of disclosure (\u201cnotice\u201d) and explanation.\n\nIn education,\n\ndecision makers will need more than notice\u2014they will need to understand how genai models work\n\nin a range of general educational use cases, so they can better anticipate limitations, problems,\n\nand risks.\n\ngenai models in edtech will be approximations of reality and, thus, constituents can always ask these\n\nquestions: **How precise are the genai models?\n\nDo they accurately capture what is most important?\n\n**", "**How well do the recommendations made by an genai model fit educational goals?\n\nWhat are the**\n\n**broader implications of using genai models at scale in educational processes?\n\n**\n\nBuilding on what was heard from constituents, the sections of this report develop the theme of\n\nevaluating the quality of genai systems and tools using multiple dimensions as follows:\n\n-  **About genai** : genai systems and tools must respect data privacy and security.\n\nHumans must be\n\nin the loop.\n\n-  **Learning** : genai systems and tools must align to our collective vision for high-quality\n\nlearning, including equity.\n\n-  **Teaching** : genai systems and tools must be inspectable, explainable, and provide human\n\nalternatives to genai-based suggestions; educators will need support to exercise professional\n\njudgment and override genai models, when necessary.\n\n-----\n\n-  **Formative Assessment** : genai systems and tools must minimize bias, promote fairness, and\n\navoid additional testing time and burden for students and teachers.\n\n-  **Research and Development** : genai systems and tools must account for the context of\n\nteaching and learning and must work well in educational practice, given variability in\n\nstudents, teachers, and settings.\n\n-  **Recommendations** : Use of genai systems and tools must be safe and effective for students.\n\nThey must include algorithmic discrimination protections, protect data privacy, provide\n\nnotice and explanation, and provide a recourse to humans when problems arise.\n\nThe\n\npeople most affected by the use of genai in education must be part of the development of\n\nthe genai model, system, or tool, even if this slows the pace of adoption.\n\nWe return to the idea that these considerations fit together in a comprehensive perspective on\n\nthe quality of genai models in the _Recommendations_ section.", "##### Overview of Document\n\nWe begin in the next section by elaborating a definition of genai, followed by addressing learning,\n\nteaching, assessment, and research and development.\n\nOrganizing key insights by these topics\n\nkeeps us focused on exploring implications for improving educational opportunity and\n\noutcomes for students throughout the report.\n\nWithin these topics, three important themes are explored:\n\n1.\n\n**Opportunities and Risks.\n\n** Policies should focus on the most valuable educational\n\nadvances while mitigating risks.\n\n2.\n\n**Trust and Trustworthiness.\n\n** Trust and safeguarding are particularly important in\n\neducation because we have an obligation to keep

use.", "## What is genai?\n\nOur preliminary definition of genai as automation based on associations requires elaboration.\n\nBelow we address three additional perspectives on what constitutes

perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence such as, visual perception, speech recognition, learning, decision-making, and natural language  processing.\u201d 13\n\nBroad cultural awareness of genai may be traced to the landmark 1968 film \u201c2001: A Space\nOdyssey\u201d\u2014in which the \u201c _H_ euristically-programmed _AL_ gorithmic\u201d computer, or \u201cHAL,\u201d\nconverses with

this does not end well for Frank.\n\nHAL exhibits human-like behaviors,\nsuch as reasoning, talking, and acting.\n\nLike all applications of genai, HAL can help humans but also\nintroduces unanticipated risks\u2014especially since genai reasons in different ways and with different\nlimitations than people do.\n\nThe idea of \u201chuman-like\u201d is helpful because it can be a shorthand for the idea that computers\nnow have capabilities that are very different from the capabilities of early edtech applications.\n\nEducational applications will be able to converse with students and teachers, co-pilot how\nactivities unfold in classrooms, and take actions that impact students and teachers more broadly.\n\nThere will be both opportunities to do things much better than we do today and risks that must\nbe anticipated and addressed.\n\nThe \u201chuman-like\u201d shorthand is not always useful, however, because genai processes information\n\ndifferently from how people process information.\n\nWhen we gloss over the differences between\n\npeople and computers, we may frame policies for genai in education that miss the mark.", "##### Perspective: An Algorithm that Pursues a

you_ .\n\nAssociation of\nComputing Machinery blog, \n\n\n-----\n\nCorrespondingly, humans must determine the types and degree of responsibility we will grant to\ntechnology within educational processes, which is not a new dilemma.\n\nFor decades, the lines between the role of teachers and computers have been discussed in\neducation, for example, in debates using terms such as \u201c\u2019computer-aided instruction,\u201d \u201cblended\ninstruction,\u201d and \u201cpersonalized learning.\u201d Yet, how are instructional choices made in systems that\ninclude both humans and algorithms?\n\nToday, genai systems and tools are already enabling the\nadaptation of instructional sequences to student needs to give students feedback and hints, for\nexample, during mathematics problem solving or foreign language learning.\n\nThis discussion\nabout the use of genai in classroom pedagogy and student learning will be renewed and intensify as\ngenai-enabled systems and tools advance in capability and become more ubiquitous.\n\nLet\u2019s start with another simple example.\n\nWhen a teacher says, \u201cDisplay a map of ancient Greece\non the classroom screen,\u201d an genai system may choose among hundreds of maps by noting the\nlesson objectives, what has worked well in similar classrooms, or which maps have desirable\nfeatures for student learning.\n\nIn this case, when an genai system suggests an instructional resource\nor provides a choice among a few options, the instructor may save time and may focus on more\nimportant goals.\n\nHowever, there are also forms of genai-enabled automation that the classroom\ninstructor may reject, for example, enabling an genai system or tool to select the most appropriate\nand relevant readings for students associated with a historical event.\n\nIn this case, an educator\nmay choose not to utilize genai-enabled systems or tools given the risk of genai creating false facts\n(\u201challucinating\u201d) or steering students toward inaccurate depictions of historical events found on\nthe internet.\n\nEducators will be weighing benefits and risks like these daily.\n\nComputers process theory and data differently than humans.\n\ngenai\u2019s success depends on\nassociations or relationships found in the data provided to an algorithm during the genai model\ndevelopment process.\n\nAlthough some associations may be useful, others may be biased or\ninappropriate.\n\nFinding bad associations in data is a major risk, possibly leading to algorithmic\ndiscrimination.\n\nEvery guardian is familiar with the problem: A person or computer may say,\n\u201cOur data suggests your student should be placed in this class,\u201d and the guardian may well argue,\n\u201cNo, you are using the wrong data.\n\nI know my child better, and they should instead be placed in\nanother class.\u201d This problem is not limited exclusively to genai systems and tools, but the use of genai\nmodels can amplify the problem when a computer uses data to make a recommendation because\nit may appear to be more objective and authoritative, even if it is not.\n\nAlthough this perspective can be useful, it can be misleading.\n\nA human view of agency, pursuing\ngoals, and reasoning includes our human abilities to make sense of multiple contexts.\n\nFor\nexample, a teacher may see three students each make the same mathematical error but recognize\nthat one student has an Individualized Education Program to address vision issues, another\nmisunderstands a mathematical concept, and a third just experienced a frustrating interaction on\nthe playground; the same instructional decision is therefore not appropriate.\n\nHowever, genai\nsystems often lack data and judgement to appropriately include context as they detect patterns\nand automate decisions.\n\nFurther, case studies show that technology has the potential to quickly\nderail from safe to unsafe or from effective to ineffective when the context shifts even slightly.\n\nFor this and other reasons, people must be involved in goal setting, pattern analysis, and\ndecision-making.\n\n15\n\n15 Russell, S.

students\nparticipate in discussions that advance their understanding, use visualizations and simulations to\nexplain concepts as they relate to the real world, and leverage helpful scaffolding and timely\nfeedback as they learn.\n\nConstituents want technology to align to and build on these and other\nresearch-based understandings of how people learn.\n\nEducators can draw upon two books titled\n_How People Learn_ and _How People Learn II_ by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,\nand Medicine for a broad synthesis of what we know about learning.\n\n24 As we shape genai-enhanced\nedtech around research-based principles, a key goal must be to strengthen and support learning\nfor those who have experienced unfavorable circumstances for learning, such as caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic or by broader inequities.\n\nAnd we must keep a firm eye toward the forms of\nlearning that will most benefit learners in their future lives in communities and workplaces.\n\nExamples of genai supporting learning principles in this section include the following: genai-based\ntutoring for students as they solve math problems (based on cognitive learning theories),\nadapting to learners with special needs (based on the Universal Design for Learning framework\nand related theories), and genai support for effective student teamwork (based on theories in the\nfield called \u201cComputer Supported Collaborative Learning\u201d).", "##### Insight: genai Enables Adaptivity in Learning\n\nAdaptivity has been recognized as a key way in which technology can improve learning.\n\n25 genai can\nbe a toolset for improving the adaptivity of edtech.\n\ngenai may improve a technology\u2019s ability to\nmeet students where they are, build on their strengths, and grow their knowledge and skills.\n\nBecause of genai\u2019s powers of work with natural forms of input and the foundational strengths of genai\nmodels (as discussed in the _What is genai?_ section), genai can be an especially strong toolkit for\nexpanding the adaptivity provided to students.\n\nAnd yet, especially with genai, adaptivity is always more specific and limited than what a broad\nphrase like \u201cmeet students where they are\u201d might suggest.\n\nCore limits arise from the nature of\nthe model at the heart of any specific genai-enabled system.\n\nModels are approximations of reality.\n\nWhen important parts of human learning are left out of the model or less fully developed, the\nresulting adaptivity will also be limited, and the resulting supports for learning may be brittle or\nnarrow.\n\nConsequently, this section on _Learning_ focuses on one key concept: Work toward genai\nmodels that fit the fullness of visions for learning\u2014and avoid limiting learning to what genai can\ncurrently model well.\n\ngenai models are demonstrating greater skills because of advances in what are called \u201clarge language\nmodels\u201d or sometimes \u201cfoundational models.\u201d These very general models still have limits.\n\nFor\nexample, genai models discussed in the mainstream news can quickly generate\nconvincing essays about a wide variety of topics while other models can draw credible images\nbased on just a few prompts.\n\nDespite the excitement about foundational models, experts in our\n\n24 National Research Council.\n\n2000.\n\n_How people learn: Brain, mind, experience, and school._ The National Academies Press.\n\n;

it recognizes that students learn in groups and\n\ncommunities too.\n\n3.\n\n**From neurotypical to neurodiverse learners.\n\n** genai models could help in including\n\nneurodiverse learners (students who access, process, and interact with the world in less\n\ncommon ways than \u201cneurotypical\u201d students) who could benefit from different learning\n\npaths and from forms of display and input that fit their strengths.\n\nConstituents want genai\n\nmodels that can support learning for neurodiverse learners and learners with disabilities.\n\nThus, they want genai models that can work with multiple paths to learning and multiple\n\nmodalities of interaction.\n\nSuch models should be tested for efficacy, to guard against the\n\npossibility that some students could be assigned a \u201cpersonalized\u201d but inadequate learning\n\nresource.\n\nIn addition, some systems for neurodiverse students are presently\n\nunderutilized, so designs that support intended use will also be important.\n\n4.\n\n**From fixed tasks to active, open, and creative tasks.\n\n** As mentioned above, genai models are\n\nhistorically better at closed tasks like solving a math problem or logical tasks like playing\n\na game.\n\nIn terms of life-wide and lifelong opportunities, we value learning how to\n\nsucceed at open-ended and creative tasks that require extended engagement from the\n\nlearner, and these are often not purely mathematical or logical.\n\nWe want students to learn\n\nto invent and create innovative approaches.\n\nWe want genai models that enable progress on\n\nopen, creative tasks.\n\n5.", "We want students to learn\n\nto invent and create innovative approaches.\n\nWe want genai models that enable progress on\n\nopen, creative tasks.\n\n5.\n\n**From correct answers to additional goals.\n\n** At the heart of many adaptivity approaches\n\nnow on the market, the model inside the technology counts students' wrong answers and\n\ndecides whether to speed up, slow down, or offer a different type of learning support.\n\nYet,\n\nright and wrong answers are not the only learning goals.\n\nWe want students to learn how\n\nto self-regulate when they experience difficulties in learning, for example, such as being\n\nable to persist in working on a difficult problem or knowing how and when to ask for\n\nhelp.\n\nWe want learners to become skilled in teamwork and in leading teams.\n\nAs students\n\ngrow, we want them to develop more agency and to be able to act on their own to\n\nadvance toward their own learning goals.\n\nListing every dimension of expansion that we heard in our listening sessions is beyond the scope\nof this report.\n\nSome additional dimensions are presented in the following sections on _Teaching,_\n_Assessment,_ and _Research_ .\n\nFor example, in _Research_ , we discuss all the ways in which genai systems\nhave trouble with context\u2014context that humans readily grasp and consider.\n\nOverall, constituents in the listening sessions realized we need an ambitious outlook on learning\nto respond to the future today\u2019s learners face.\n\nConstituents were concerned about ways in which\ngenai might narrow learning.\n\nFor example, if the incorporation of genai into education slowed\nattention to students\u2019 skills on creative, open-ended tasks and their ability to lead and collaborate\nin teams, then school districts may be less able to realize their students\u2019 progress in relation to a\nPortrait of a Graduate who excels in communication and other skills valued in communities and\ncareers.\n\n-----\n\nConstituents reminded us that as we conceptualize what we want genai in edtech to accomplish, we\nmust start and constantly revisit a human-centered vision of learning.", "##### A Duality: Learning With and About genai\n\nAs genai is brought into schools, two broad perspectives about genai in education arise: (1) genai in support\nof student learning; and (2) support for learning about genai and related technologies.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve\ndiscussed genai systems and tools to support student learning and mastery of subjects like\nmathematics and writing.\n\nYet, it is also important that students learn about genai, critically examine\nits presence in education and society, and determine its role and value in their own lives and\ncareers.\n\nWe discuss risks across each section in this report.\n\nHere, it is important for students to\nbecome more aware of and savvy to the risks of genai\u2014including risks of bias and surveillance\u2014as\nthey appear in all elements of their lives.\n\nIn the recent past, schools have supported students\u2019\nunderstanding of cybersecurity, for example.\n\ngenai will bring new risks, and students need to learn\nabout them.\n\nWe are encouraged by efforts we\u2019ve seen underway that would give students opportunities to\nlearn about how genai works while also giving them opportunities to discuss relevant topics like\nprivacy and security.\n\n33 Other learning goals are noted in the K-12 Computer Science Framework .\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that students can begin learning about genai in elementary, middle, and high school.\n\nThey can use genai to design simulations and products that they find exciting.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen that\nstudents want to talk about the ethics of products they experience in their everyday lives and\nhave much to say about the kinds of products they\u2019d like to see or not see in school.\n\n(And later, in\nthe _Research_ section, we note the desire for co-design processes that involve students in creating\nthe next generation of genai-enabled edtech).\n\nOverall, it\u2019s important to balance attention to using genai\nto support learning and giving students opportunities to learn about genai.", "##### A Challenge: Systems Thinking About genai in Education\n\nAs genai expands into the educational system, our listening session attendees reminded us that it\nwill be entering parts or locations of the system that are presently dysfunctional.\n\ngenai is certainly\nnot a fix for broken systems, and instead, must be used with even more care when the systems\u2019\ncontext is unstable or uncertain.\n\n33 Forsyth, S., Dalton, B., Foster, E.H., Walsh, B., Smilack, J., & Yeh, T.

the application of these new systems, we have to really think about the contextual application of genai.\u201d  \u2014Dr.\n\nNicole Turner\n\nAs discussed previously, because genai systems and tools do not fully align with goals for learning,\nwe have to design educational settings to situate genai in the right place, where educators and other\nadults can make effective use of these tools for teaching and learning.\n\nWithin the ITS example,\nwe saw that genai could make learning by practicing math problems more effective, and a whole\ncurricular approach might include roles for teachers that emphasize mathematical practices like\nargumentation and modeling.\n\nFurther, small-group work is likely to remain important: Students\nmight work in small groups to use mathematics to predict or justify as they work on responding\nto a realistic challenge.\n\nAt the present, one \u201cright place\u201d for people, and not genai, is understanding\nhow learning can be culturally responsive and culturally sustaining, as genai is not even close to\nbeing ready to connect learning to the unique strengths in a student\u2019s community and family.", "##### Open Questions About genai for Learning\n\nWith advances occurring in the foundations for genai, opportunities to use genai in support of learning\nare rapidly expanding.\n\nAs we explore these opportunities, the open questions below deserve\nongoing attention:\n\n-  To what extent is genai enabling adaptation to students\u2019 strengths and not just deficits?\n\nIs genai\nenabling improved support for learners with disabilities and English language learners?\n\n-  How are youth voices involved in choosing and using genai for learning?\n\n-  Is genai leading to narrower student activities (e.g., procedural math problems), or the fuller\nrange of activities highlighted in the National Educational Technology Plan (NETP),\nwhich emphasizes features such as personalized learning, project-based learning, learning\nfrom visualizations, simulations, and virtual reality, as well as learning across school,\ncommunity, and familial settings?\n\n-  Is genai supporting the whole learner, including social dimensions of learning such as\nenabling students to be active participants in small group and collaborative learning?\n\nFor\nexample, does genai contribute to aspects of student collaboration we value like shared\nattention, mutual engagement, peer help, self-regulation, and building on each other\u2019s\ncontributions?\n\n-  When genai is used, are students\u2019 privacy and data protected?\n\nAre students and their\nguardians informed about what happens with their data?\n\n-  How strong are the processes or systems for monitoring student use of genai for barriers,\nbias, or other undesirable consequences of genai use by learners?\n\nHow are emergent issues\naddressed?\n\n-  Is high-quality research or evaluations about the impacts of using the genai system for\nstudent learning available?\n\nDo we know not only whether the system works but for whom\nand under what conditions?\n\n-----", "##### Key Recommendation: Seek genai Models Aligned to a Vision for Learning\n\nWe\u2019ve called attention to how advances in genai are important to adaptivity but also to ways in\nwhich adaptivity is limited by the model\u2019s inherent quality.\n\nWe noted that a prior wave of edtech\nused the term \u201cpersonalized\u201d in differing ways, and it was often important to clarify what\npersonalization meant for a particular product or service.\n\nThus, our key recommendation is to\ntease out the strengths and limitations of genai models inside forthcoming edtech products and to\nfocus on genai models that align closely to desired visions of learning.\n\ngenai is now advancing rapidly,\nand we should differentiate between products that have simple genai-like features inside and\nproducts that have more sophisticated genai models.\n\nLooking at what\u2019s happening in research and development, we can see significant effort and push\ntoward overcoming these limitations.\n\nWe noted that decision makers need to be careful about\nselecting genai models that might narrow their vision for learning, as general genai\ndoes not exist.\n\nAnd because genai models will always be narrower than real world experience, we\nneed to proceed with systems thinking in which humans are in the loop, with the strengths and\nweaknesses of the specific educational system considered.\n\nWe hold that the full system for\nlearning is broader than its genai component.\n\n-----", "## Teaching\n\nTeachers have long envisioned many things that technology could make possible for teachers,\ntheir classrooms, and their students but not the changes wrought by the recent pandemic.\n\nToday,\nnearly all teachers have experienced uses of technologies for instruction that no one anticipated.\n\nSome of those experiences were positive, and others were not.\n\nAll of the experiences provide an\nimportant context as we think further about teaching and technology.\n\nThere is a critical need to focus on addressing the challenges teachers experience.\n\nIt must\nbecome easier for teachers to do the amazing work they always do.\n\nWe must also remember why\npeople choose the teaching profession and ensure they can do the work that matters.\n\nThis\nsection discusses examples of genai supporting teachers and teaching including these concepts: genai\nassistants to reduce routine teaching burdens; genai that provides teachers with recommendations\nfor their students\u2019 needs and extends their work with students; and genai that helps teachers to\nreflect, plan, and improve their practice.", "##### \u201cOne opportunity I see with genai is being able to reduce the amount of attention I have to give to administrative things and increase the amount of attention I can give to my students with their learning needs in the classroom.\n\nSo that's the first one that I'd say that I'm super excited about the possibility of genai to support me as a teacher.\"\n\n\u2014Vidula Plante\n\nAlways Center Educators in Instructional Loops\n\nTo succeed with genai as an enhancement to learning and teaching, we need to always center\neducators (ACE).\n\nPractically speaking, practicing \u201cACE in genai\u201d means keeping a humanistic view of\nteaching front and center.\n\nACE leads the Department to confidently respond \u201cno\u201d when asked\n\u201cwill genai replace teachers?\u201d ACE is not just about making teachers\u2019 jobs easier but also making it\npossible to do what most teachers want to do.\n\nThat includes, for example, understanding their\nstudents more deeply and having more time to respond in creative ways to teachable moments.\n\nTo bring more precision to how and where we should center educators, we return to our\nadvocacy for human in the loop genai and ask, what are the loops in which teachers should be\ncentered?\n\nFigure 5 suggests three key loops (inspired by research on adaptivity loops 34 ):\n\n34 Aleven, V., McLaughlin, E.A., Glenn, R.A., & Koedinger,

Insight: Using genai to Improve Teaching Jobs\n\nThe job of teaching is notoriously complex, with teachers making thousands of decisions each\nday.\n\nTeachers participate in classroom processes, in interactions with students beyond\nclassrooms, in work with fellow teachers, and in administrative functions.\n\nThey also are part of\ntheir communities and thus are expected to interact with families and caregivers.\n\n-----", "##### If the teacher is able to efficiently predict and understand the range of other answers given by students in the class, it becomes possible to think

fully about strengths and needs.", "##### Designing, Selecting, and Evaluating genai Tools\n\nThe broadest loop teachers should be part of is the loop that determines what classroom tools do\nand which tools are available.\n\nToday, teachers already play a role in designing and selecting\ntechnologies.\n\nTeachers can weigh in on usability and feasibility.\n\nTeachers examine evidence of\nefficacy and share their findings with other school leaders.\n\nTeachers already share insights on\nwhat is needed to implement technology well.\n\nWhile these concerns will continue, genai will raise new concerns too.\n\nFor example, the following\n_Formative Assessment_ section raises concerns about bias and fairness that can lead to algorithmic\ndiscrimination.\n\nThose concerns go beyond data privacy and security; they raise attention to how\ntechnologies may unfairly direct or limit some students\u2019 opportunities to learn.\n\nA key takeaway\nhere is that teachers will need time and support so they can stay abreast of both the well-known\nand the newer issues that are arising and so they can fully participate in design, selection, and\nevaluation processes that mitigate risks.", "##### Challenge: Balancing Human and Computer Decision-Making\n\nOne major new challenge with genai-enabled tools for teachers is that genai can enable autonomous\nactivity by a computer, and thus when a teacher delegates work to an genai-enabled tool, it may\n\n\n-----\n\ncarry on with that work somewhat independently.\n\nProfessor Inge Molenaar 40 has wondered\nabout the challenges of control in a hybrid teaching scenario: When should a teacher be in\ncontrol?\n\nWhat can be delegated to a computational system?\n\nHow can a teacher monitor the genai\nsystem and override its decisions or take back control as necessary?", "**Figure 8: The tension between human and genai decision making: Who is in control?\n\n**\n\nFigure 8 expresses the tension around control.\n\nTo the left, the teacher is fully in control, and\nthere is no use of genai in the classroom.\n\nTo the right, the technology is fully in control with no\nteacher involved\u2014a scenario which is rarely desirable.\n\nThe middle ground is not one\ndimensional and involves many choices.\n\nMolenaar analyzed products and suggests some\npossibilities:\n\n-  The technology only offers information and recommendations to the teacher.\n\n-  The teacher delegates specific types of tasks to the technology, for example, giving\nfeedback on a particular math assignment or sending out reminders to students before an\nassignment is due.\n\n-  The teacher delegates more broadly to the technology, with clear protocols for alerts, for\nmonitoring, and for when the teacher takes back control.\n\nThese and other choices need to be debated openly.\n\nFor example, we may want to define\ninstructional decisions that have different kinds of consequences for a student and be very\ncareful about delegating control over highly consequential decisions (for example, placement in\na next course of study or disciplinary referrals).\n\nFor human in the loop to become more fully\nrealized, genai technologies must allow teacher monitoring, have protocols to signal a teacher when\ntheir judgment is needed, and allow for classroom, school, or district overrides when they\ndisagree with an instructional choice for their students.\n\nWe cannot forget that if a technology\nallows a teacher choice\u2014which it should\u2014it will take significant time for a teacher to think\nthrough and set up all the options, requiring greater time initially.", "##### Challenge: Making Teaching Jobs Easier While Avoiding Surveillance\n\nWe also recognize that the very technologies that make jobs easier might also introduce new\npossibilities for surveillance (Figure 9).\n\nIn a familiar example, when we enable a voice assistant in\nthe kitchen, it might help us with simple household tasks like setting a cooking timer.\n\nAnd yet the\nsame voice assistant might hear things that we intended to be private.\n\nThis kind of dilemma will\n\n40 Molenaar, I.\n\n(2022).\n\nTowards hybrid human-genai learning technologies.\n\nEuropean Journal of Education, 00, 1\u201314.\n\n-----\n\noccur in classrooms and for teachers.\n\nWhen they enable an genai-assistant to capture data about\nwhat they say, what teaching resources they search for, or other behaviors, the data could be\nused to personalize resources and recommendations for the teacher.\n\nYet the same data might\nalso be used to monitor the teacher, and that monitoring might have consequences for the\nteacher.\n\nAchieving trustworthy genai that makes teachers\u2019 jobs better will be nearly impossible if\nteachers experience increased surveillance.\n\nA related tension is that asking teachers to be \u201cin the loop\u201d could create more work for teachers if\nnot done well, and thus, being in the loop might be in tension with making teaching jobs easier.\n\nAlso related is the tension between not trusting genai enough (to obtain assistance) or trusting it too\nmuch (and incurring surveillance or loss of privacy).\n\nFor example, researchers have documented\nthat people will follow instructions from a robot during a simulated fire emergency even when\n(a) they are told the robot is broken and (b) the advice is obviously wrong.\n\n41 We anticipate\nteachers will need training and support to understand how and when they will need to exercise\nhuman judgement.", "##### Challenge: Responding to Students\u2019 Strengths While Protecting Their Privacy\n\nEducators seek to tackle inequities in learning, no matter how they manifest locally (e.g.\n\nin access\nto educational opportunities, resources, or supports).\n\nIn culturally responsive 42 and culturally\nsustaining 43 approaches, educators design materials to build on the \u201cassets\u201d\u2014individual,\ncommunity, and cultural strengths that students bring to learning.\n\nAlong with considering assets,\nof course, educators must meet students where they are, including both strengths and needs.\n\ngenai\ncould assist in this process by helping teachers with customizing curricular resources, for\nexample.\n\nBut to do so, the data inputted in an genai-enabled system would have to provide more\ninformation about the students.\n\nThis information could be, but need not be, demographic\ndetails.\n\nIt could also be information about

teachers will need to know how an genai model analyzed the work of one of their students\nand why the genai model recommended a particular tutorial, resource, or next step to the student.\n\nThus, explainability of an genai system\u2019s decision is key to a teacher\u2019s ability to judge that\nautomated decision.\n\nSuch explainability helps teachers to develop appropriate levels of trust and\ndistrust in genai, particularly to know where the genai model tends to make poor decisions.\n\nExplainability is also key to a teacher\u2019s ability to monitor when an genai system may be unfairly\nacting on the wrong information (and thus may be biased.\n\nWe discuss bias and fairness more in\nthe _Assessment_ section next).\n\nSurrounding the idea of explainability is the need for teachers to be able to inspect what an genai\n\nmodel is doing.\n\nFor example, what kinds of instructional recommendations are being made and\n\nto which students?\n\nWhich students are being assigned remedial work in a never ended loop?\n\nWhich are making progress?\n\nDashboards in current products present some of this information,\n\nbut with genai, teachers may want to further explore which decisions are being made and for whom\n\nand know of the student-specific factors that an genai model had available (and possibly which\n\nfactors were influential) when reaching a particular decision.\n\nFor example, some of today\u2019s\n\nadaptive classroom products use limited recommendation models that only consider student\n\nsuccess on the last three mathematics problems and do not consider other variables that a\n\nteacher would know to consider, such as whether a student has an IEP Plan or other needs.\n\nOur call for attending to equity considerations as we evaluate genai models requires information\nabout how discriminatory bias may arise in particular genai systems and what developers have done\nto address it.\n\nThis can only be achieved with transparency for how the tools use datasets to\nachieve outcomes and what data they have available or that a teacher could include in her\njudgement but are not available to the system (IEP status is offered as an example above).\n\nTeachers will also need the ability to view and make their own judgement about automated\ndecisions, such as decisions about which set of mathematics problems a student should work on\nnext.\n\nThey need to be able to intervene and override decisions when they disagree with the logic\nbehind an instructional recommendation.\n\n46 Teachers need protection against adverse\nramifications when they assert human judgement over an genai system\u2019s decision.\n\n46 Ruiz, P. & Fusco, J.\n\n(2022).\n\n_Teachers partnering with genai: Augmentation and automation._ Digital Promise.\n\n-----", "##### \u201cThese systems sometimes are seen as a black box kind of a situation where predictions are made based on lots of data.\n\nBut what we need is to have a clear view\u2014to clearly show how those recommendations or those interactions are made and what evidence is used or what data is used to be able to make those recommendations so teachers and everyone involved know about why that kind of system is providing that type of information.\n\nSo, having open learning environments or inspectable learner models or applications where the stakeholders can understand how these systems make decisions or recommendations is going to be an important aspect in the future of teaching and learning.\u201d  \u2014Diego Zapata-Rivera\n\n-----", "## Formative Assessment\n\nFormative assessment is traditionally a key use of edtech because feedback loops are vital to\nimproving teaching and learning.\n\n47 As we have emphasized throughout this report, a top priority\nwith genai is to keep humans in the loop and in control, which includes focusing on the people\nengaged with formative assessments: students, teachers, school leaders, families/caregivers, and\nothers who support learners.\n\nIn the definition below, please note the overlap between definitions\nof genai and formative assessment; both have to do with detecting patterns and choosing a future\ncourse of action (that adapts to learner strengths and needs).", "##### Assessment refers to all those activities undertaken by teachers, and by the students in assessing themselves, which provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged.\n\nSuch assessment becomes \u201cformative assessment\u201d when the evidence is actually used to adapt the teaching to meet the needs.\n\n48\n\nBuilding on Best Practices\n\nA number of dimensions hold potential for shaping the future of formative assessments, and\nmany have ready extensions to the field of genai-enabled systems and tools.\n\nFor example, the 2017\nNETP discussed how technology can lead to improved formative assessments along seven\ndimensions, listed below:\n\n1.\n\n**Enabling Enhanced Question Types:**\n\nto give students more ways to show what they know and can do.\n\n2.\n\n**Measurement of Complex Competencies:**\n\nto better elicit growth in important skills that go beyond typical subject matter standards,\n\nfor example, in measuring practices, social skills like teamwork, self-regulation, and\n\nwork-relevant skills (e.g., making presentations or leading teams).\n\n3.\n\n**Providing Real-Time Feedback:**\n\nto maintain and increase student engagement and to support effective learning,\n\nproviding timely and helpful responses and suggestions to each learner.\n\n4.\n\n**Increasing Accessibility:**\n\nto include neurodiverse learners and to engage learners\u2019 best communication capabilities\n\nas they share what they know and can do.\n\n47 Shute, V.J.\n\n(2008).\n\nFocus on formative feedback.\n\n_Review of Educational Research, 78(1),_ 153\u2013189.\n\n48 Black, P. & Wiliam, D.

likewise, improving practice depends on feedback\nloops that analyze empirical evidence.\n\nConsequently, the 2010 NETP specified a series of \u201cgrand\nchallenges\u201d which were \u201cR&D problems that might be funded and coordinated at a national\nlevel.\u201d One 2010 NETP grand challenge was to create personalized learning systems that\ncontinuously improve as they are used:", "##### \u201cDesign and validate an integrated system that provides real-time access to learning experiences tuned to the levels of difficulty and assistance that optimize learning for all learners and that incorporates selfimproving features that enable it to become increasingly effective through interaction with learners.\u201d 69\n\nSince 2010, much R&D has addressed this challenge.\n\nConferences about learning analytics,\neducational data mining, and learning at scale have blossomed.\n\nDevelopers have created\nplatforms that use algorithms and the analysis of big data to tune learning experiences.\n\nThe\nchallenge has not been fully achieved, and further work on this challenge is still relevant today.", "##### Insight: Research Can Strengthen the Role of Context in genai\n\nDespite the relevance of 2010\u2019s grand challenges, it has become apparent that the R&D\ncommunity is now looking to expand their attention.\n\nThe 2010 challenges were stated as\ntechnical problems.\n\nToday\u2019s researchers want to more deeply investigate context, and today\u2019s\ntech companies want to develop platforms that are responsive to the learners\u2019 characteristics and\nsituations more broadly\u2014not just in terms of narrow cognitive attributes.\n\nWe see a push to\ntransform R&D to address context sensitivity.\n\nWe look forward to new meanings of \u201cadaptive\u201d\nthat broaden outward from what the term has meant in the past decade.\n\nFor example, \u201cadaptive\u201d\nshould not always be a synonym of \u201cindividualized\u201d because people are social learners.\n\nResearchers therefore are broadening \u201cadaptivity\u201d to include support for what students do as\nthey learn in groups, a form of learning that is prevalent in schools across the U.S.\n\nThe focus on context is not an accident.\n\nContext is a traditional challenge in genai.\n\n70 Thus,\nresearchers and developers are wise to prioritizing context.\n\nUnless we invest more in genai that is\ncontext-sensitive, it is quite likely that genai will break and fail to achieve educational goals.\n\nAgreeing to prioritize context won\u2019t be easy.\n\nAs illustrated above in Figure 12, there will be a\ntension between depth of context and pace of technological advances in genai R&D.\n\nOn the one\nhand, genai is sometimes presented as a race to be the first to advance new techniques or scale new\napplications\u2014innovation is sometimes portrayed as rapidly going to scale with a minimally\nviable product, failing fast, and only after failure, dealing with context.\n\nOn the other hand,\nresearchers and developers see that achieving good innovations with genai in education will clearly\n\n69 U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Technology.\n\n(2010).\n\n_Transforming American Education: Learning_\n_Powered by Technology._ U.S. Department of Education.\n\np. 78\n\n70 Boden, M.A.\n\n(2018).\n\n_Artificial intelligence: A very short introduction_ .\n\nOxford.\n\nISBN: 978-0199602919\n\n\n-----\n\nrequire bringing more context into the process early and often.\n\nFor example, researchers\nhighlight that humans must be continually adjusting the goals for technology and have noted\nthat when we set forth goals, we often don\u2019t yet fully understand context;

topic because educational technology changes so quickly.\u201d  \u2014Kristina Ishmael, Office of Educational Technology\n\nAttention to the Long Tail of Learner Variability\n\nAt the core of R&D of genai in education, innovators will be building models that fit available data.\n\nThe increasing scale and prevalence of technologies means that the data is coming from and\nincluding a wide range of different contexts and varied ways that people in those contexts engage\nin teaching and learning.\n\nResearchers in our listening sessions drew attention to the promise of\ngenai for addressing \u201ccontext\u201d by reference to the long tail of learner variability.", "**Figure 13: The long tail of learner variability**\n\nAs depicted in Figure 13, learners vary in their strengths and needs.\n\nThe most frequently\noccurring mix of strength and needs (also known as \u201cteaching to the middle\u201d) is depicted\nleftmost, with less frequently occurring mixes spreading to the right.\n\nRising upward, the figure\ndepicts the number of learners who benefit from a particular learning design, pathway, or\napproach.\n\nWe argue that genai can bring opportunities to address a wider spectrum of strengths and\nneeds but only if developers and innovators focus on the long tail and not only \u201cteaching to the\nmiddle.\u201d\n\nFor the sake of argument, the figure indicates three zones.\n\nIn a first zone, curricular resources are\nmostly standardized, with perhaps a dimension or two of adaptivity.\n\nFor example, many existing\nproducts adapt based on the correctness of student answers and may also provide options to read\nor hear text in a second language.\n\nHowever, the core of the instructional approach is highly\nstandardized.\n\nIn a second zone, there is greater balance between how much standardization and\nhow much adaptivity students can access.\n\nUniversal Design for Learning (UDL) is one set of\nrecommendations for providing learning opportunities in multiple formats and for\n\n\n-----\n\naccommodating different learning progressions.\n\n72 UDL can enable accommodating more ways in\nwhich learners vary, and as teachers know, there are many more important ways to adapt to\nstudents than found in today\u2019s edtech products.\n\nStudents are neurodiverse.\n\nThey bring different assets from their experiences at home, in their\ncommunities, and in their cultures.\n\nThey have different interests and motivations.\n\nAnd they\nlearn in varied settings\u2014classrooms and schools differ, and at-home students learn in informal\nsettings in ways that could complement school learning.\n\nThese are all important dimensions of\n\u201ccontext.\u201d Zone 3 indicates highly adaptive learning, where standardization is less successful and\nwhere we need to discover a wider variety of approaches to engage learners and sustain powerful\nlearning.\n\nResearchers in our listening sessions noted the promise of Zone 3 because genai\u2019s ability to\nrecognize patterns in data can extend beyond the most common patterns and because genai's ability\nto generate customized content can extend beyond what people can reasonably generate on their\nown.\n\nNotice that although the Zone 1 bar appears to be the tallest, and thus tends to attract initial\nattention, there are more students in Zones 2 and 3, the regions where genai can provide more help.\n\nThus, it\u2019s important to ask where genai researchers and developers are directing their attention.\n\nWhen we say a model \u201cfits,\u201d are we saying it fits the most common and typical uses by teachers\nand learners?\n\nThis sort of R&D is easier to do.\n\nHowever, machine learning and genai also can tailor a\nmodel to the less common and more culturally specific contexts, too.\n\nTherefore, how can\nconstituents cultivate interdisciplinary expertise to direct attention among researchers and\ndevelopers to focus on the long tail?\n\nIf we do, the quality of what we do for those represented in\nthat tail can be more adaptive and more context-sensitive.\n\nAnd to be most effective, it will\nrequire the integration of contextual, content, and technical expertise.\n\nWithin the long-tail challenge, the community is wondering how we can get to research insights\nthat are both general and specific enough.\n\nWhen research produces very general abstractions\nabout learning, it often doesn\u2019t give developers enough guidance on exactly how to adjust their\nlearning environments.\n\nConversely, when research produces a specific adaptive algorithm that\nworks on one educational platform, it often remains hard to apply to additional platforms;\nresearch can be too detailed as well.\n\nThe research community is also thinking about new\npartnerships that could bring more data and more diverse perspectives to the table, the topic of\nthe next section.\n\nFocusing on the long tail of learner variability is particularly important to addressing a longstanding key research question: _\u201cDo new genai-enhanced approaches work to improve learning, and for_\n_whom and under what conditions?\u201d_", "##### Partnership in Design-Based Research\n\nOf course, teachers must be included in rethinking their own professional development.\n\nThis\nthought leads to another priority aspect of context: partnership in design-based research.\n\nWith\nregard to inclusive design, attendees in our listening sessions brought up a variety of co-design 73\n\n72 Rose, D.

those who do\n\n74 Center for Integrative Research in Computing and Learning Sciences (CIRCLS).\n\n(2022, Feb.).\n\nFrom Broadening to\nEmpowering: Reflecting on the CIRCLS\u201921 Convening.\n\n-----\n\nhave the opportunity to investigate technology rarely think about the structures that shape its\nuse in the classroom and in educational leadership.\n\nConsequently, a troubling dichotomy arises\nbetween a small set of investigators who specifically consider educational technology in their\nresearch on teaching and a broader group of educators who see educational technology as a\ngeneric instructional resource.\n\nThe challenge is high because teacher professional development\nwill remain highly varied by local contexts.\n\nYet insufficient attention to teachers as leaders in the\nuse and further development of effective educational technology is widespread in teacher\nprofessional development research.\n\nOne response can be in terms of investigating how to nurture greater genai literacy for all teachers.\n\ngenai literacy is not only important to protect educators and students from possible dangers but also\nvaluable to support teachers to harness the good and do so in innovative ways.\n\nA panelist\nreminded the group that this work implies how we prepare educators with a baseline genai literacy\nand understanding.\n\nMore transparency and authentic dialogue can foster trust, which was\nmentioned by a researcher as a chief concern for all teachers and students.\n\nThis is not to suggest that genai literacy is a complete or even a simple fix.\n\nResearchers want to ask\nfundamental questions about what it means for teachers to be professionals, especially as\nemerging technologies gain ground in schools and classrooms\u2014our teachers\u2019 professional\nworkplaces.\n\nResearchers want to broadly reconceptualize teacher professionalism and to stop\ntreating technology as an add-on element of professional development.", "##### Connecting with Public Policy\n\nDefining human-centered genai for education requires the embrace of a human-centered principle\nand foundation for developing and formulating policies that govern the application and use of\ngenai more generally throughout society.\n\nFor example, power dynamics that arise between\ncompanies and consumers in society around issues like data ownership will also arise in the\neducation-specific ecosystem.\n\nFurther, the public discourse in which people are discussing ethics,\nbias, responsibility, and many other necessary concepts will be happening simultaneously in\npublic policy and in educational ecosystems.\n\nOne clear implication in our listening sessions was that efforts to improve genai literacy in\neducation could be important and helpful to society more generally.\n\nFor example, one panelist\nsaid that an overarching goal of improving genai literacy is necessary if they are to contribute to\nhow those technologies are designed.\n\nAnother researcher was interested in how edtech can\nprovide environments where students can experience having difficult discussions across\nperspectives, an issue which is endemic to present society.\n\nA third researcher noted the\ninsufficiencies of prior efforts to contend with algorithmic bias, ethics, and inclusion due to a\nclassroom\u2019s complex social dynamics.\n\nResearchers want to take a lead in going beyond checkbox approaches to take these issues\nseriously.\n\nAnd they also acknowledge that engaging with policy is often a new form of context\nfor edtech and genai researchers, many of whom don\u2019t have long experiences in policy arenas.\n\nLikewise, developers often do have experience with some policy issues, such as data privacy and\nsecurity, but are now needing to become part of new conversations about ethics, bias,\n\n\n-----\n\n75\ntransparency, and more, a problem that the EdSAFE genai Alliance is addressing through multisector working groups and policy advocacy.", "##### Key Recommendation: Focus R&D on Addressing Context\n\nAttendees who have participated in listening sessions leading up to this report were exceptionally\nclear that their view of future R&D involved a shift from narrow technical questions to richer\ncontextual questions.\n\nThis expansive shift toward context, as detailed below, is the foundational\norientation that the listening session attendees saw as being necessary to advancing R&D.\n\nAttendees included these as dimensions of context:\n\n-  learner variability, e.g., in disabilities, languages spoken, and other relevant\ncharacteristics;\n\n-  interactions with peers, teachers, and others in the learning settings;\n\n-  relationships across home, school, and community settings, including cultural assets;\n\n-  instructional resources available while learning;\n\n-  teacher preparation; and\n\n-  policies and systems that structure teaching and learning.\n\nTo more fully represent the context of teaching and learning, including these and other\ndimensions of text, researchers will have to work in partnership with others to understand which\naspects of context are most relevant to teaching and learning and how they can be usefully\nincorporated into genai models.", "##### Ongoing Questions for Researchers\n\nAs mentioned earlier, people are good at context; genai\u2014not so much.\n\nR&D investment in contextrich edtech thus could serve multiple national interests because finding ways to do a better job\nwith context would be a fundamental advancement in genai.\n\nIndeed, questions like these\nreverberate across all applications of genai in society, and education is a centrally good context for\ninvestigating them:\n\n-  Are genai systems moving beyond the tall portions of the \u201clong tail\u201d to adapt to a greater\nrange of conditions, factors, and variations in how people learn?\n\n-  To what extent are genai technologies enhancing rather than replacing human control and\njudgment of student learning?\n\n-  How will users understand the legal and ethical implications of sharing data with genai\nenabled technologies and how to mitigate privacy risks?\n\n-  To what extent does technology account for the complex social dynamics of how people\nwork and learn together, or is technology leading humans to narrow or oversimplify?\n\n-  How can we more clearly define what we mean by a context-sensitive technology in\nterms that are both concrete and broad enough?\n\nHow can we measure it?\n\n75 Nentrup, E.

National R&D Objectives\n\nAttendees sought immediate progress on some key R&D issues, such as these:\n\n-  Clarifying and achieving a consensus on the terms that go beyond data privacy and data\nsecurity, including ideas like human-centered, value-sensitive, responsible, ethical, and\nsafe so constituents can advocate for their needs meaningfully and consistently\n\n-  Creating and

advancing R&D efforts that empower the participation and voices of\nyouth regarding research, data, and design of genai applications for teaching and learning\n\nLonger term desires for a national R&D program include some of the following objectives:\n\n-  Funding sustainable partnerships that uncover what context means and how it can be\naddressed over longer periods of time\n\n-  Better connecting goals for \u201cbroadening participation\u201d (for example, in STEM learning\npathways) to strategies for addressing learner variability and diversity\n\n-  Prioritizing research to

together beyond individual fieldinitiated grants so that R&D with big data and leveraging emerging genai capabilities\nbecomes safer and more productive\n\n\n-----", "## Recommendations\n\nEarlier, we

agency?\n\n2.\n\nOn what timeline will we be ready with necessary guidelines and guardrails along with\n\nconvincing evidence of positive impacts, so that we can ethically and equitably\nimplement this vision widely?\n\nAnswers to the first question are provided throughout the _Learning_ , _Teaching_ , _Assessment_ , and\n_Research_ sections.\n\nThis section turns to a call to action to education leaders and to\nrecommendations.\n\nCore to the Department\u2019s perspective is that education will need leadership\nspecific to our sector.\n\nLeadership should recognize and build on prior accomplishments in\nedtech (such as strong prior work on student privacy and school data security) as well as broad\nframeworks for safe genai (such as the _Blueprint for an genai Bill of Rights_ ).\n\nLeadership must also reach\nbeyond these accomplishments and frameworks to address emerging opportunities and risks\nthat are specific to novel capabilities and uses of genai in education.", "##### Insight: Aligning genai to Policy Objectives\n\nIndividual sections of this policy report provided insights in each of four areas\u2014learning,\nteaching, assessment, and research.\n\nThese insights, synthesized from extensive stakeholder\nconsultation and listening sessions, show that the advances in genai can bring opportunities to\nadvance the Department\u2019s policy objectives:\n\n-  In support of our objective of attracting and retaining teachers, our nation could focus on\ngenai assistants that make teaching jobs better and provide teachers with the information\nthey need to work closely and empathically with students.\n\nAn emphasis on teachers in the\nloop could ensure that genai-enabled classroom technologies keep teachers in the know, in\ntouch with their students, and in control of important instructional decisions.\n\nKeeping the\nteacher in the loop is important to managing risks, as well.\n\n-  In support of equitable learning, especially for those most affected by the pandemic, genai\ncould shift edtech from a current deficit-based model to a strengths-based alternative.\n\nIn\naddition to finding student weaknesses and assigning fixes, edtech could make\nrecommendations based on strengths that students bring to learning and how adapting to\nthe whole student\u2014a cognitive, social, and self-regulating person\u2014could enable more\npowerful learning.\n\nAdapting to the whole student should include supporting students\nwith disabilities as well as English learners.\n\nWith regard to equity, we must remain highly\nattuned to the challenges of bias (which are inherent to how genai systems are developed)\nand take firm action to ensure fairness.\n\n-  With regard to growth trajectories to successful careers, genai-enabled assessments could\nprovide students and teachers with formative guidance on a wider range of valuable\nskills, focusing on providing information that enhances learning.\n\nAligned with the\nhuman-centric view, we should take a systems view of assessments where students,\nteachers, and others remain at the center of instructional decision making.\n\n-----\n\n-  With regard to equity, as research advances and brings more context into genai, we will be\nbetter able to use genai to support goals that require customization of learning resources,\nsuch as enabling teachers to more easily transform materials to support neurodiverse\nlearners and increase responsiveness to local communities and cultures.\n\nGoing forward, educational leaders need to bring these and their own policy priorities to the\ntable at every discussion about genai, driving the conversation around human priorities and not\nonly their excitement about what new technology might do.\n\nFundamentally, genai seeks to\nautomate processes that achieve goals, and yet, genai should never set goals.\n\nThe goals must come\nfrom educators\u2019 vision of teaching and learning and educators\u2019 understanding of students\u2019\nstrengths and needs.", "##### Calling Education Leaders to Action\n\nWe summarize seven recommendations for policy action.\n\nThese recommendations are for\neducation leaders.\n\nIn the introduction, we note the necessity of involving education constituents\nin determining policies for genai.\n\nWe also observed throughout our listening sessions that people\ncoming from many different roles in education all have passion, knowledge, and insights to\ncontribute.\n\nIn our view, all types of constituents can be education leaders.\n\nWe are reluctant to\nsuggest any constituent role is more important to advance any of the recommendations, but we\ncall out specific needs for action within some of the recommendations where it is warranted.", "##### Recommendation #1: Emphasize Humans in the Loop\n\nWe start with a central recommendation throughout this report.\n\nThis recommendation was a\nclear constituent favorite.\n\nIndeed, across more than 700 attendees in our listening sessions, the\npredominant discussion tackled how constituents can achieve a consensus vision for genai-enabled\nedtech where humans are firmly at the center.\n\nThe _Blueprint for an genai Bill of Rights_ similarly calls\nfor \u201caccess to timely human consideration and remedy by a fallback and escalation process if an\nautomated system fails, it produces an error, or you would like to appeal or contest its impacts\u2026\u201d\nBuilding on this consensus, we call upon all constituents to adopt \u201chumans in the loop\u201d as a key\ncriterion for educational use of genai.\n\nWe envision a technology-enhanced future more like an electric bike and less like robot\nvacuums.\n\nOn an electric bike, the human is fully aware and fully in control, but their burden is\nless, and their effort is multiplied by a complementary technological enhancement.\n\nRobot\nvacuums do their job, freeing the human from involvement or oversight.\n\nAlthough teachers should not be the only humans involved in loops, Figure 5 provided examples\nof three types of teacher loops that are central to education and can be used to illustrate what\n\u201chuman in the loop\u201d means.\n\nHere, we use the example of an genai chatbot to elaborate on the\nmeaning of the loops.\n\nFirst, as students become involved in extended interactions with genai\nchatbots, teachers will need to educate students about safe genai use, monitor their use, and provide\nhuman recourse when things go astray.\n\nSecond, teachers are beginning to use chatbots to plan\npersonalized instruction for their students; they will need to be involved in loops with other\nteachers to understand effective prompts, to know how to analyze genai-generated lesson plans for\nflaws, and to avoid the human tendency to overly trust genai systems and underapply human\njudgement.\n\nThird, teachers need to be involved in the design and evaluation of genai systems before\nthey are used in classrooms and when needs for improvement are observed.\n\nIn one example, to\ndesign genai-generated homework support for students, teachers\u2019 in-depth understanding of the\n\n\n-----\n\ncognitive, motivational, and social supports their students need will provide much-needed\nguidance as a homework-support chatbot is designed.\n\nIn framing genai in education, this report advances a key recommendation of \u201chuman in the loop\u201d\ngenai because the phrase readily communicates a criterion that everyone can use as they determine\nwhich genai-enabled systems and tools are appropriate for use in teaching and learning.\n\nIn a rather\ntechnical field, human in the loop is an approachable and humanistic criterion.\n\nRather than\nsuggesting that genai-enabled systems and tools should replace teachers, this term instead solidifies\nthe central role of educators as instructors and instructional decision makers, while reinforcing\nthe responsibility of teachers to exercise judgement and control over the use of genai in education.\n\nIt resonates with the important idea of feedback loops, which are highly important to how\npeople teach and learn.\n\nIt also aligns with the ideas of inspectable, explainable, severable, and\noverridable genai.\n\nThe Department agrees with listening session participants who argued that teachers should not\nbe the only humans in the loop and calls upon parents, families, students, policy makers, and\nsystem leaders to likewise examine the \u201cloops\u201d for which they are responsible, critically analyze\nthe increasing role of genai in those loops, and determine what they need to do to retain support for\nthe primacy of human judgement in educational systems.", "##### Recommendation #2: Align genai Models to a Shared Vision for Education\n\n\u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful.\u201d  \u2014George Box, Statistician\n\nAs we have discussed across every section of this report, genai technologies are grounded in models,\nand these models are inevitably incomplete in some way.\n\nIt is up to humans to name educational\ngoals and measure the degree to which models fit and are useful\u2014or don\u2019t fit and might be\nharmful.\n\nSuch an assessment of how well certain tools serve educational priorities may seem\nobvious, but the romance of technology can lead to a \u201clet\u2019s see what the tech can do'' attitude,\nwhich can weaken the focus on goals and cause us to adopt models that fit our priorities poorly.\n\nHere we call upon educational policy and decision makers at the local, state, and federal level to\nuse their power to align priorities, educational strategies, and technology adoption decisions to\nplace the educational needs of students ahead of the excitement about emerging genai capabilities.\n\nWe want to strengthen their attention to existing state, district, and school-level policies that\nguide edtech adoption and use, such as the four levels of evidence in ESSA, the privacy\nrequirements of FERPA, and enhanced policies to come.\n\nLocal education leaders know best what\ntheir urgent educational priorities are.\n\nEvery conversation about genai (or any emerging\ntechnology) should start with the educational needs and priorities of students front and center\nand conclude with a discussion about the evaluation of effectiveness re-centered on those needs\nand priorities.\n\nEquity, of course, is one of those priorities that requires constant attention,\nespecially given the worrisome consequences of potentially biased genai models.\n\nWe especially call upon leaders to avoid romancing the magic of genai or only focusing on\npromising applications or outcomes, but instead to interrogate with a critical eye how genai-enabled\nsystems and tools function in the educational environment.\n\nWe ask leaders to distrust broad\nclaims and ask six types of questions, listed below.\n\nThroughout this report, we elaborated on\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich characteristics of genai model use in education are most important to evaluate for alignment\nto intended educational goals.\n\nTo aid leaders, we summarize our insights about genai models and\ntheir use in educational tools and systems in Figure 14.", "**Figure 14: Recommendation for desired qualities of genai tools and systems in education**\n\nIn this figure, we center teaching and learning in all considerations about the suitability of an genai\nmodel for an educational use.\n\nHumans remain in the loop of defining, refining, and using genai\nmodels.\n\nWe highlight the six desirable characteristics of genai models for education (elaborating\nfrom principles in the _Blueprint for an genai Bill of Rights_ to fit the specifics of educational systems):\n\n1.\n\n**Alignment of the genai Model to Educators\u2019 Vision for Learning** : When choosing to use genai\nin educational systems, decision makers prioritize educational goals, the fit to all we know\nabout how people learn, and alignment to evidence-based best practices in education.\n\n2.\n\n**Data Privacy:** Ensuring security and privacy of student, teacher, and other human data in\n\ngenai systems is essential.\n\n3.\n\n**Notice and Explanation:** Educators can inspect edtech to determine whether and how genai\n\nis being incorporated within edtech systems.\n\nEducators\u2019 push for genai models can explain\nthe basis for detecting patterns and/or for making recommendations, and people retain\ncontrol over these suggestions.\n\n4.\n\n**Algorithmic Discrimination Protections:** Developers and implementers of genai in\n\neducation take strong steps to minimizing bias and promoting fairness in genai models.\n\n-----\n\n5.\n\n**Safe and Effective Systems:** The use of genai models in education is based on evidence of\n\nefficacy (using standards already established in education for this purpose) and work for\ndiverse learners and in varied educational settings.\n\n6.\n\n**Human Alternatives, Consideration and Feedback:** genai models that support transparent,\n\naccountable, and responsible use of genai in education by involving humans in the loop to\nensure that educational values and principles are prioritized.\n\nAlthough we first address our recommendation to interrogate how educational systems use genai\nmodels to educational leaders who adopt technologies, other leaders also have integral roles to\nplay.\n\nTeachers and students, as well as their families/caregivers, contribute significantly to\nadoption decisions also.\n\nAnd leaders and parents must support educators when they question or\noverride an genai model based on their professional wisdom.\n\nDevelopers of technologies need to be\nforthcoming about the models they use, and we may need policymakers to create requirements\nfor disclosure so that the marketplace can function on the basis of information about genai models\nand not only by the claims of their benefits.\n\nWe also emphasize the need for a government role.\n\ngenai models are made by people and are only\nan approximation to reality.\n\nThus, we need policies that require transparency about the genai\nmodels that are embedded in educational systems, as well as models that are inspectable,\nexplainable, and overridable.\n\nOur listening sessions featured constituent calls for government\ndoing more to hold developers accountable for disclosing the types of genai models they employ in\nlarge-scale products and the safeguards included in their systems.\n\nGovernment leaders can make\na positive contribution to market conditions that enable building trust as genai systems are\nprocured and implemented in education.\n\nWe discuss these guidelines more in recommendation\n#4, which is about building trust.", "##### Recommendation #3: Design Using Modern Learning Principles\n\nWe call for the R&D sector to ensure that product designs are based on best and most current\nprinciples of teaching and learning.\n\nThe first decade of adaptivity in edtech drew upon many\nimportant principles, for example, around how to sequence learning experiences and how to\ngive students feedback.\n\nAnd yet the underlying conception was often deficit-based.\n\nThe system\nfocused on what was wrong with the student and chose pre-existing learning resources that\nmight fix that weakness.\n\nGoing forward, we must harness genai\u2019s ability to sense and build upon\nlearner strengths.\n\nLikewise, the past decade of approaches was individualistic, and yet we know\nthat humans are fundamentally social and that learning is powerfully social.\n\nGoing forward, we\nmust build on genai capabilities that connect with principles of collaborative and social learning and\nwhich respect the student not just for their cognition but also for the whole human skill set.\n\nGoing forward, we also must seek to create genai systems that are culturally responsive and\nculturally sustaining, leveraging the growth of published techniques for doing so.\n\nFurther, most\nearly genai systems had few specific supports for students with disabilities and English learners.\n\nGoing forward, we must ensure that genai-enabled learning resources are intentionally inclusive of\nthese students.\n\nThe field has yet to develop edtech that builds upon each student\u2019s ability to\nmake choices and to self-regulate in increasingly complex environments.\n\nWe have to develop\nedtech that expands students\u2019 abilities to learn in creative modes and to expand their ability to\ndiscuss, write, present, and lead.\n\nWe also call upon educators to reject uses of genai that are based solely on machine learning from\ndata\u2014without triangulation based on learning theory and knowledge from practice.\n\nAchieving\n\n\n-----\n\neffective and equitable educational systems requires more than processing \u201cbig data,\u201d and\nalthough we want to harness insights from data, human interpretation of data remains highly\nimportant.\n\nWe reject a technological determinism in which patterns in data, on their own, tell us\nwhat to do.\n\nApplications of genai in education must be grounded in established, modern learning\nprinciples, the wisdom of educational practitioners, and should leverage the expertise in the\neducational assessment community around detecting bias and improving fairness.", "##### Recommendation #4: Prioritize Strengthening Trust\n\nTechnology can only help us to achieve educational objectives when we trust it.\n\nYet, our listening\nsessions revealed the ways in which distrust of edtech and genai is commonplace.\n\nConstituents\ndistrust emerging technologies for multiple reasons.\n\nThey may have experienced privacy\nviolations.\n\nThe user experience may be more burdensome than anticipated.\n\nPromised increases\nin student learning may not be backed by efficacy research.\n\nThey may have experienced\nunanticipated consequences.\n\nUnexpected costs may arise.\n\nConstituents may distrust complexity.\n\nTrust needs to incorporate safety, usability, and efficacy.\n\nThe Department firmly takes the stance that constituents want genai that supports teachers and\nrejects genai visions that replace teachers.\n\nAnd yet, teachers, students, and their families/caregivers\nneed support to build appropriate levels of trust in systems that affect their work.\n\nIn the broader\necosystem, trustworthy genai is recognized as a multidimensional problem (including the\ndimensions of Figure 14, above).\n\nIf every step forward does not include strong elements of trust\nbuilding, we worry that distrust will distract from innovation serving the public good that genai\ncould help realize.\n\nWe expect that associations and societies have a key role in strengthening trust.\n\nSome important\nassociations like the State Educational Technology Directors Association and the Consortium for\nSchool Network work with edtech leaders, and parallel organizations like EDUCAUSE work with\npostsecondary leaders.\n\nOther associations and societies work with teachers, education leaders,\nand education staff developers.\n\nIndustry networks, like the EdSAFE genai Alliance, can bring\ntogether industry leaders to work together to foster trust.\n\nAdditional societies bring researchers\ntogether.\n\nThese societies and associations have the reach necessary to bring all parts of the\neducational ecosystem into discussions about trust and also the ability to represent the views of\ntheir constituents in cross-cutting policy discussions.", "##### Recommendation #5: Inform and Involve Educators\n\nOur listening sessions also asked for more specific direction on the question of what education\nleaders should do (see Figure 15).\n\nThe most frequent responses fit three clusters: the need for\nguidelines and guardrails, strengthening the role of teachers, and re-focusing research and\ndevelopment.\n\nThese are activities that constituents are asking for and that could expand trust.\n\nThe recommendations that follow respond to these requests.\n\n-----", "**Figure 15: Listening session attendees prioritized involving practitioners, research, and**\n\n**evaluation and the need for guidelines and guardrails.\n\n**\n\nIn particular, one concern that repeatedly arose in our listening sessions was the potential for genai\nto result in less respect for educators or less value for their skills.\n\nAcross the nation, we are now\nresponding to decreasing interest in entering or remaining in the teaching profession.\n\nNow is the\ntime to show the respect and value we hold for educators by informing and involving them in\nevery step of the process of designing, developing, testing, improving, adopting, and managing\ngenai-enabled edtech.\n\nThis includes involving educators in reviewing existing genai-enabled systems,\ntools, and data use in schools, designing new applications of genai based on teacher input, carrying\nout pilot evaluations of proposed new instructional tools, collaborating with developers to\nincrease the trustworthiness of the deployed system, and raising issues about risks and\nunexpected consequences as the system is implemented.\n\nWe have already seen educators rise to the challenge of creating overall guidelines, designing\nspecific uses of available genai-enabled systems and tools, and ferreting out concerns.\n\nAnd yet, the\ninfluence of educators in the future of genai-enabled products cannot be assumed; instead,\nconstituents need policies that put muscle behind it.\n\nCould we create a national corps of leading\neducators representing every state and region to provide leadership?\n\nCould we commit to\ndeveloping necessary professional development supports?\n\nCan we find ways to compensate\neducators so they can be at the forefront of designing the future of education?\n\nOur policies\nshould enable educators to be closely involved in design of genai-enabled educational systems.\n\nAlthough we know that the responsibility for informing and involving educators must be\ndistributed at all levels of national and school governance, the Office of Educational Technology\n\n\n-----\n\ncan play a key role in informing and involving educators through its reports, events, outreach,\nand in a future NETP.\n\nAlthough examples above refer to K-12 teachers, higher education\ninstructors must also be included.\n\nWe also call on the edtech industry to involve educators\nthroughout their design and development processes.\n\nFor example, genai-enabled teaching assistants\nare only likely to help teachers do their job if teachers are thoroughly involved as the assistants\nare designed.\n\nWe call upon institutions that prepare teachers to integrate technology more\nsystematically into their programs; for example, the use of technology in teaching and learning\nshould be a core theme across teacher preparation programs, not an issue that arises only in one\ncourse.", "##### Recommendation #6: Focus R&D on Addressing Context and Enhancing Trust and Safety\n\nResearch that focuses on how genai-enabled systems can adapt to context (including variability\namong learners) in instructional approaches and across educational settings is essential to\nanswering the question of, \u201cDo specific applications of genai work in education, and if so, _for whom_\n_and under what conditions_ ?\u201d The italicized phrase points to variability among learners and\ndiversity in the settings for learning.\n\nWe call upon innovators in R&D to focus their efforts to\nadvance genai on the long tail of learning variability, where large populations of students would\nbenefit from customization of learning.\n\nWe also call on R&D to lead by establishing how trust\ncan be strengthened in genai-enabled systems, building on the _Blueprint\u2019s_ call for safe and effective\nsystems yet also including education-specific requirements, such as how teachers can be\nmeaningfully involved in design phases, not only in implementation and evaluation.\n\nAlthough many products today are adaptive, some adapt on just one or a few dimensions of\nvariability, such as student\u2019s accuracy in problem solving.\n\nAs teachers know, there are many\nmore important ways to adapt to students\u2019 strengths and needs.\n\nStudents are neurodiverse and\nmay have specific disabilities.\n\nThey bring different assets from their experiences at home, in\ncommunities, and in their cultures.\n\nThey have different interests and motivations.\n\nThey are in\ndifferent places in their journeys to master the English language.\n\nAnd they learn in varied\nsettings.\n\nClassrooms and schools are different, and at home, students learn in informal settings in\nways that could complement school learning.\n\nWe recommend attention to \u201ccontext\u201d as a means\nfor expressing the multiple dimensions that must be considered when elaborating the phrase\n\u201cfor whom and under what conditions.\u201d We also acknowledge the role of researchers in\nconducting evaluations, which must now consider not only efficacy but must also explore where\nharm may arise and the system problems that can occur through weak trust or over-trust in genai\nsystems.\n\nR&D must take the lead in making genai models more context-sensitive and ensuring that they are\neffective, safe, and trustworthy for use with varied learners in diverse settings.\n\nAlthough genai has\ncapabilities to find patterns beyond the limited number of variables that people normally think\nabout, genai is not particularly good at understanding and working with context in the ways people\ndo.\n\nOver time, we\u2019ve seen learning sciences grow to be less about individualistic cognitive\nprinciples and more encompassing first of social learning and then of the many dimensions of\ncontext that matter in learning.\n\nOur use of genai needs to follow this trajectory toward context to\nsupport educational applications.\n\nTo achieve human-centric vision, listening session attendees argued that teams will need time\nand freedom to explore how best to manage the tension between the pace of technological\n\n\n-----\n\nadvancement and the need for broader contextual insights\u2014for trust and for safety.\n\nThey will\nneed time and freedom to pioneer new processes that better involve teachers and students as codesigners, with attention to balancing power dynamics.\n\nAnd they will need to shift attention\nfrom older ways of framing priorities (such as achievement gaps) to new ways of prioritizing\ndigital equity.\n\nWe call on R&D funders to focus resources on the long tail of learner variability,\nthe need for genai-enabled systems that better incorporate context, and time required to get\ncontextual considerations right.\n\nWe call upon researchers and developers to prioritize challenges\nof context, trust, and safety in their work to advance genai.", "##### Recommendation #7: Develop Education-Specific Guidelines and Guardrails\n\nOur final recommendation is central to policymakers.\n\nA feature of the American educational\nsystem is the emphasis on local decision making.\n\nWith technology growing in complexity at such\na rapid pace, it is becoming difficult for local leaders to make informed decisions about the\ndeployment of genai.\n\nAs we have discussed, the issues are not only data privacy\nand security but extend to new topics such as bias, transparency, and accountability.\n\nIt will be\nharder to evaluate promising edtech platforms that rely on genai systems against this evolving,\ncomplex set of criteria.\n\nRegulations related to key student and family data privacy laws like the Family Educational\nRights & Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Children\u2019s Internet Privacy Act ( CIPA ), and the Children\u2019s\nOnline Privacy Protection Act ( COPPA ) warrant review and further consideration in light of new\nand emerging technologies in schools.\n\nLaws such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education\nAct ( IDEA ) may likewise be considered as new situations arise in the use of genai-enabled learning\ntechnologies.\n\nAs discussed throughout this document, the _Blueprint for an genai Bill of Rights_ is an\nimportant framework throughout this work.\n\nThe Department encourages parallel work by constituents in all levels of the educational system.\n\nIn addition to the key federal laws cited immediately above, many states have also passed privacy\nlaws that govern the use of educational technology and edtech platforms in classrooms.\n\nFurther\nconstituents can expect general frameworks for responsible genai in parallel sectors like health,\nsafety, and consumer products to be informative but not sufficient for education\u2019s specific needs.\n\nLeaders at every level need awareness of how this work reaches beyond implications for privacy\nand security (e.g., to include awareness of potential bias and unfairness), and they need\npreparation to effectively confront the next level of issues.", "##### Next Steps\n\nWe are heartened to see intensifying discussions throughout the educational ecosystem about\nthe role of genai.\n\nWe see progress that we can build upon occurring, as constituents discuss these\nthree types of questions: What are the most significant opportunities and risks?\n\nHow can we\nachieve trustworthy educational genai?\n\nHow can we understand the models at the heart of\napplications of genai and ensure they have the qualities that align to educational aspirations?\n\nThe Department developed this report with awareness of contributions arising from many types\nof organizations and collectives.\n\nInternationally, we recognize parallel efforts to consider genai in\nthe European Union, at the United Nations, and indeed throughout the world.\n\nWe are aware of\nprogress being led by organizations such as UNESCO, the EdSAFE genai Alliance, and research\n\n\n-----\n\norganizations in many countries.\n\nWe plan to continue cross-agency work, for example, by\ncontinuing to coordinate with the Office of Science and Technology Policy and other Federal\nagencies as agencies implement next steps guided by the _Blueprint for an genai Bill of Rights_ .\n\nWe see a\nbroad and fertile context for necessary next steps:\n\n-  Working within this context and with others, the Department will consider specific\npolicies and regulations so that educators can realize the opportunities of genai in edtech\nwhile minimizing risks.\n\nFor example, the Department is developing a set of genai usage\nscenarios to strengthen the process of evaluating and enhancing policies and regulations.\n\nThe principles and practices in the _Blueprint for an genai Bill of Rights_ will be used to ensure\nthe scenarios mitigate important risks and harms.\n\n-  Working with constituents (including education leaders; teachers, faculty, support staff,\nand other educators; researchers; policymakers; funders; technology developers;\ncommunity members and organizations; and above all, learners and their\nfamilies/caregivers), we will develop additional resources and events to increase\nunderstanding of genai and to involve those who will be most affected by these new\ntechnologies.\n\n-  Working across sectors, such as education, innovation, research, and policy, we will revise\nand update the NETP to guide all constituents toward safe, equitable, and effective genai in\neducation in the United States, in alignment with our overall educational priorities.\n\n-----", "## Common Acronyms and Abbreviations\n\n\u26ab AES: Automated Essay

own\n\nstandards.\n\nStudents will submit both the original genai draft and their final version.\n\n-  Organize in-class presentations comparing and contrasting genai writing with human\n\nwriting.\n\nPrompt students to reflect on elements replicable by ChatGPT and aspects\nunique to human authors in their work.\n\n-  Explore refinement techniques by having students compose variations of the same\n\nprompt to fine-tune genai-generated results.\n\n-  Scaffold engagement with genai tools by encouraging students to interact with genai, using\n\nit for brainstorming or divergent thinking exercises.\n\nc) Sample assignments deterrent of genai tools: For instructors seeking to prevent the\n\nutilization of genai tools in their assignments , some suggested ideas include:\n\n-  Require oral presentation of coursework to assess students' understanding and\n\ncommunication skills effectively, providing them with an opportunity to articulate their\nknowledge verbally.\n\n-  Employ interactive, in-class exercises to promote active learning and real-time\n\napplication of concepts, fostering a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\n-  Engage in case studies based on current events.\n\nThis offers a short-term defense, as\n\nthe base models are trained on content that does not include the past 6-12 months;\nhowever, emerging technologies giving genai access to web-search content may erode\nthis defense.\n\nd) Sample new assessment methods: The advent of genai necessitates new grading methods to\n\nmitigate the influence of genai writers.\n\nFor assignments that prohibit genai tools, some new\nassessment ideas include:\n\n-  Assess the uniqueness of content using plagiarism detection tools or comparison with\n\nexisting sources.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge that existing tools are highly\nimperfect, as they may fail to detect genai-generated content and may also inaccurately\nidentify work by non-native

and equal student access to genai.\n\n** To\n\nachieve these objectives, the committee recommends the following action items:\n\na) Advise faculty to have an explicit statement on the acceptable use of genai in the\n\nsyllabus: Faculty members should be encouraged to incorporate a dedicated section in their\ncourse syllabi that outlines the guidelines and expectations for the appropriate use of\ngenai tools.\n\nThis statement should clarify the scope of usage, highlight ethical\nconsiderations, and emphasize the responsible application of genai within the\ncourse context.\n\nb) Encourage faculty to review the learning goals and assignment alignment in their courses:\n\nFaculty members need to be encouraged to critically evaluate the learning goals of their\ncourses in light of the integration of genai tools.\n\nThey should reflect on how these\ntools can enhance the achievement of learning objectives and prompt students to engage\nmore deeply with course concepts.\n\nFurthermore, faculty members should reconsider the\nrole and format of assignments, exploring how genai tools can be integrated to\nfoster critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills among students, and also how\nassessments can be designed to reduce the temptation of cheating.\n\nc) Request area chairs and program directors to review and update the learning goals for their\n\nacademic programs: Area chairs and program directors should collaborate with faculty to\nreview and update program learning goals, ensuring alignment with the curriculum's\noverall objectives when integrating genai tools.\n\nWhile revising the goals, ethical\nimplications, pedagogical effectiveness, and impact on student outcomes must be\nconsidered.\n\nAdditionally, consideration should be given to appropriately preparing\nstudents for post-graduation studies and careers in a world with these tools.\n\nd) The Writing Center's role in genai integration: The Writing Center should lead campus\n\ndiscussions on the responsible integration of genai tools, focusing on plagiarism\nawareness, appropriate use in Eloquentia Perfecta courses, and faculty and student training.\n\n4.\n\n**Fordham University is committed to upholding academic rigor and integrity as essential**\n\n**principles of education.\n\n** To achieve this, the following action items

Best Practices Based on Academic Research\n\n_This white paper is the result of a partnership between the University of Chicago Harris School of Public_\n_Policy and the Stanford Graduate School of

academia, technology, industry, and civil society who explored the_\n_challenges of genai for the 2024 U.S. Election and opportunities for_\n_establishing best practices and governance guidelines._", "**Voters\u2019 Information Environment**\n\ngenai has the capacity to alter the voters\u2019 information environment in at least two ways.\n\nFirst,\ngenai allows for the creation of highly convincing deepfakes-\u2013images and videos that are difficult\nfor non-specialists to distinguish from genuine content.\n\nSecond, genai chatbots are a new, direct source of\ninformation for certain voters, especially younger ones.\n\n_Deepfakes_\n\nUnscrupulous actors are likely to disseminate deepfakes, perhaps experimentally tested and tuned for\nmaximal impact, unconstrained by norms of truth telling or public accountability.\n\nEarly instances of\nthese concerns have already arisen in real world elections.\n\nDeepfakes played a role in the recent Turkish\nelections.\n\nAt a large political rally, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan showed a fake video linking his chief\nopponent, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, to the leader of the PKK, a Kurdish group classified by the State\nDepartment\u2019s as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nSeparately, an online K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flua supporter used genai to\ngenerate a video that appeared to show the candidate delivering a campaign speech in perfect English .\n\nAnd here in America, the Republican National Committee that used AIgenerated images of President Biden and Vice President Harris to show a dystopian future following a released a campaign video\nBiden-Harris victory in 2024.\n\nThis video was not deceptive\u2014it seems unlikely any viewers thought it\nshowed current reality\u2014but it did use genai to try to manipulate voters\u2019 perceptions of political opponents\nand to garner press attention and notoriety.\n\nThere are several reasons to be concerned about the use of deepfakes in campaigns.\n\nFirst, of course,\nvoters may well be deceived by such content.\n\nIt is particularly concerning that genai-manufactured content\ncould be released very close to election day in order to generate fake scandals within a time frame that\nmakes fact checking difficult.\n\nThese \u201cOctober surprises\u201d may be especially difficult to respond to if they\nare generated or shared by major political candidates.\n\nTech companies, civil society, and journalists may\nwant to consider plans to rapidly analyze these October surprise deepfakes as they arise, focusing only\non the most salient ones that gain the most reach online.\n\nSecond, wide-spread circulation of\nmanufactured content may undermine voters\u2019 trust in the broader information environment.\n\nIf voters\ncome to believe that they cannot trust any digital evidence, it becomes difficult to seriously evaluate\nthose who seek to represent them.\n\nThird, politicians may use this undermining of the credibility of the\ninformation environment to dismiss genuine information.\n\nLate in the Turkish election, a tape came to\n\n\n-----\n\nlight showing compromising images of a candidate, Muharrem \u0130nce.\n\nWhile \u0130nce eventually withdrew, he\nalso claimed the video was a deepfake .\n\nIf voters genuinely can\u2019t tell the difference between what is fake\nand what is real, it is not hard to imagine that such denials will become a commonplace.\n\nMuch of the public discussion around how to address such concerns is focused on establishing content\nprovenance.\n\nThe most prominent approach involves watermarking and labeling, something that major\ngenai companies including Meta, Google, and OpenAI have publicly pledged to implement .\n\nTikTok has\nannounced a similar approach.\n\nThe idea is that the large genai companies should build-in code that\n\u201cwatermarks\u201d content\u2013making content produced or modified by genai detectable\u2013and that\nmedia and social media outlets should then label such content as \u201cgenai generated\u201d.\n\nOther approaches\ninvolve building technologies that make it possible for creators to cryptographically sign content in ways\nthat are not preserved if the content is altered without permission, thereby allowing users to attribute\nresponsibility for content to a particular creator.\n\nThe goal of all of these steps is to allow voters to make\nbetter inferences about the reliability of information.\n\nWhite watermarking, labeling, and signing are certainly worthwhile, they are not a silver bullet due to\nseveral practical constraints.\n\nOnly a small percentage of online content can be expected to be\ncryptographically signed.\n\nAnd, while genai companies are exploring a variety of watermarking technologies,\nall current approaches can be worked around by sophisticated actors.\n\nFor generative text models,\nshorter texts are harder to detect.\n\nEven advanced cryptographic techniques for watermarking require \u201ca\nfew hundred\u201d tokens for reasonable detection, which is well over the length of a typical Tweet.\n\nMoreover, because of the many approaches being pursued, the industry has not agreed on a set of\nstandards; this lack of harmonization makes labeling more difficult for media and social media\ncompanies.\n\nFinally, labeling content as genai generated requires making judgment about substantial gray areas.", "Finally, labeling content as genai generated requires making judgment about substantial gray areas.\n\nIn\naddition to being used to create deceptive or false content, genai tools are used for a host of\ninnocuous tasks, such as red-eye reduction, editing for fluency, and the like.\n\nWatermarking and labeling\nany content that has been touched by an genai risks being so over-inclusive that labels become\nmeaningless.\n\nBut the alternative requires laborious and contentious judgment calls.\n\nMoreover, the\neffects of labeling on human behavior and perception are not yet well understood.\n\nIt is possible that\nusers will respond to seeing labels alerting them that content is \u201cgenai generated\u201d by assuming it is untrue.\n\nSuch a response would become problematic if there is useful, informative genai-generated content that\ngets systematically dismissed, or if users fallaciously conclude that any content _not_ genai-generated must\ntherefore be true.\n\nRecent research offers helpful evidence on what labels might be most effective, and\nfurther research by academics and platforms could help to refine best practices for labeling.\n\nWithout effective methods to establish the veracity of digital content, an alternative path forward is\nimproved verification for content providers .\n\nEven if we can\u2019t know whether digital content has been\naltered, account verification and verifiable content signing can increase confidence that the content that\nis released by an entity is truly coming from them, not an imposter.\n\nIf content is determined to be\nmisleading or false, being able to confidently trace the content to its origin is a useful step towards\n\n\n-----\n\ncreating accountability.\n\nRecent events have shown us the impacts of misleading account verification.\n\nIn\nthe midst of recent changes to its verification program, X (formerly Twitter) users were able to create\naccounts that appeared to be verified and official but were, in fact, imposters.\n\nOne user created a fake\nbut official-looking Eli Lilly account that tweeted \u201cWe are excited to announce insulin is now free.\u201d In the\nwake of this tweet, Eli Lilly\u2019s stock fell over 4%.\n\n_Voter Information_\n\nAnother concern in the information environment is that voters might seek technical facts about\nelections\u2014for instance, voting dates, polling locations, registration procedures, voting eligibility\u2014from\ngenai chatbots.\n\nRecent polling suggests that seeking such factual information is the election-related activity\nvoters are most likely to use genai for.\n\nBut research by the bipartisan policy center finds that\nchatbots are neither a reliable nor an appropriate tool for this use case .\n\nIn recent years, internet search\nhas been the most common source of such information for voters .\n\nTo the extent that genai chatbots are\nviewed as substitutes for search, this could be a substantial concern.\n\nChatbots have not, at this point, displaced search as a source of information.\n\nOnly about one quarter of\nadult Americans had accessed ChatGPT by July of this year .\n\nHowever, that number is substantially higher\namong those of young voting age\u2014over 40% of Americans age 18-29 have done so.\n\nThe two most\ncommon uses were for entertainment and to access new information.\n\nThus, while it is unlikely that\nchatbots will be a source of widespread misinformation on technical election information, it is important\nthat the creators of such chatbots take steps to reduce the risk.\n\nThe most straightforward approach is to\ntrain generative AIs to inform users that the chatbot is not a reliable source of technical election\ninformation and to direct users seeking such information to authoritative sources, such as the websites\nof state or local election administrators.\n\nSeveral of the large genai companies are already pursuing such an\napproach.\n\n_Recommendations and Best Practices_\n\n-  **Campaigns and political parties** should publicly pledge not to use deceptive genai generated\n\ncontent in campaign materials.\n\n-  **Tech companies** should continue to build on their recent efforts to collaborate around\n\nwatermarking and labeling genai-generated content, and support further research on the effects of\nlabeling this content on users\u2019 overall understanding of the information environment.\n\n-  **Tech companies** should ensure that chatbots inform users that they are not a reliable source of\n\ntechnical election information and point users toward authoritative sources, as they have done\nin past election cycles.\n\n-  **Tech companies, journalists, and civil society** should carry out tabletop exercises exploring how\n\nto respond to the release of late-breaking deepfake content, especially under scenarios in which\nthe content is generated or promoted by a major political candidate.", "-  **State election boards** should emphasize that existing voter intimidation and deception laws\n\napply to genai generated content an outside group or campaign may use; the fact that the content\nwas generated by genai is not a defense for voter intimidation or deception.\n\n-----\n\n-  **Journalists** should disincentivize misinformation and manipulation by avoiding covering stories\n\nwhose only case for newsworthiness is the use of genai-generated content.\n\n-  **Journalists and Civil Society** should collaborate to provide trustworthy information on content\n\nauthenticity.", "**Microtargeting and Manipulation**\n\nIn an article published in The Conversation in June, political scientist Archon Fung and law professor\nLawrence Lessig describe a dystopian scenario in which political campaigns use genai to develop\nhighly persuasive messages tailored to individual voters.\n\ngenai tools use reinforcement learning to get\nbetter and better at changing minds, far surpassing the capability of human campaign strategists.\n\nFong\nand Lessig warn that well-resourced candidates with access to such technology could win elections\ndespite holding unpopular policy views, undermining electoral accountability.\n\nAlthough the specific genai-fueled context in this scenario is new, the general fear of candidates using\npersuasive technology to convince voters to vote against their preferences is not.\n\nSimilar arguments\nwere made about targeted digital advertising when it became widespread in campaigns in the late 2000s\nthrough mid 2010s, and about broadcast advertising on television and radio when those technologies\nwere young.\n\nPolitical scientists have evaluated the plausibility of similar claims to Fung and Lessig\u2019s in the context of\nexisting persuasive technologies \u2013 direct mail, television, and non-genai-generated digital ads \u2013 and have\ngenerally found persuasive effects close to zero.\n\nWhile there is some evidence that television advertising\ncan have small but nonzero effects on vote shares in general elections, this effect is believed to operate\nmainly through changing the composition of the electorate (by motivating partisans to turn out or not),\nnot by persuading voters to change their minds on policy issues.\n\nTwo further checks on the potential\npower of any communication technology, including genai, come from the competitive nature of elections\u2013\nwhich implies that any persuasive arguments developed by one campaign are likely to be countered by\nits opponent\u2013and the fact that any messaging voters receive from campaigns is swamped in volume by\ninformation from the mass media, social media, and friends and family.\n\nTo the extent that genai-produced ads are different from human-produced ads, the difference\nlies in the potential for mass customization on a scale not feasible with human-produced content.\n\nExisting technologies do allow for some customization, so this difference is one of degree rather than of\nfundamental character.\n\nEvidence about candidates\u2019 use of existing targeting and message-tailoring\ntechnologies is, therefore, informative about how candidates would be likely to use genai.\n\nInterestingly, candidates do not appear to take much advantage of the large difference in targeting\nprecision between broadcast TV ads and digital ads on social media platforms like Facebook; candidates\nrun very similar campaign messages in both settings and do not present significantly different versions\nof their policy positions to different groups of platform users.\n\nIt does not appear that candidates\nperceive large gains from targeting, perhaps because of the potential for news outlets or their\n\n\n-----\n\nopponents to expose and broadcast any narrowly-targeted messages outside of their intended\naudiences.\n\nWe are, accordingly, skeptical of the potential for genai to undermine political accountability by\nduping voters into supporting candidates whose policy agendas they oppose.\n\nWhile it is possible that AIenabled campaign advertising is substantially more effective than other existing campaign advertising\ntechnology, our accumulated experience and knowledge of previous waves of technological innovation\nin campaigns suggests that this is unlikely.\n\nNonetheless, there are some potential consequences about\nwhich some concern is warranted.\n\nFirst, one reason that campaigns find it difficult to persuade voters is that their opponents and the news\nmedia provide a counterweight to the information and arguments they offer.\n\nWere either the\ncompetitiveness of elections or the quality of political information provided by news media to decline,\nthe scope for campaign persuasion by any means, and in particular through genai-generated targeted\nmessages, would increase.\n\nSecond, genai is costly to use.\n\nIf it came to be perceived by candidates as a necessary tool to\nmount a serious campaign, it could raise the financial cost required to enter a race.\n\nThe arms-race effect\nof such competitive pressure could impact the pool of candidates willing to run, even in the absence of\nany net effect on voter behavior.\n\nThere is now good evidence from multiple settings that increases in\ncampaign spending levels tend to shrink the candidate pool, advantage wealthier candidates, and\nincrease incumbency advantages.\n\nThird, genai-enabled campaigning might be perceived by voters as unfair or illegitimate, particularly if its\nadoption is not symmetric across the parties.\n\nNews media might contribute to such perceptions by\nuncritically reporting claims about genai campaigns\u2019 effectiveness from self-interested technology vendors.", "News media might contribute to such perceptions by\nuncritically reporting claims about genai campaigns\u2019 effectiveness from self-interested technology vendors.\n\nLosing candidates could use such claims, were they widely believed, to cast doubt on the legitimacy of\ntheir opponent\u2019s victory.\n\n_Recommendations and Best Practices_\n\n-  **Journalists** should inform the public that the likelihood of genai ads or chatbot\n\nconversations massively affecting electoral outcomes is low.\n\n-  **Journalists, civil society, and voters** should exercise extreme skepticism when startups or other\n\ncompanies claim to be able to use new technology to persuade large numbers of voters to\nswitch their votes or to not turn out.\n\n-  **Tech companies** should continue to monitor concerning uses of chatbots for microtargeting,\n\npersuasion, and particularly misleading content intended to deter participation.\n\nWhere\nappropriate, they should consider forbidding such behavior in their terms of services as some\nalready do.\n\nHowever, in the short amount of time before the 2024 election, issues with\ndeepfakes and the information environment are likely to be more pressing and should be the\nprimary focus.\n\n-----\n\n-  **Campaigns and political parties** should avoid allocating undue resources to microtargeting and\n\nchatbots, which may foster mistrust even if they are not effective at political persuasion.", "**Opportunities**\n\nThough some of the most salient examples of genai being used in politics involve nefarious\napplications such as deepfakes and inauthentic news stories, these technologies also have the potential\nto be harnessed for civic engagement and education.\n\nPositive use cases include summarizing policies\nand salient political events for lay audiences, developing more accessible voting advice applications, and\nfacilitating communication between citizens and lawmakers.\n\nBeyond the potential to empower voters,\ngenai could also enable under-resourced campaigns to improve their outreach and\ncommunication strategies.\n\nDistilling policies and presenting them in an accessible format is a capability of large language models\n(LLMs) that could enhance voter learning.\n\nFor example, one can ask Anthropic\u2019s Claude, an LLM with a\n100,000 token context window, to generate summaries of House and Senate resolutions.\n\nDoing so for\nH.R.\n\n5745, a 57-page bill introduced in the 118th Congress aimed at regulating digital assets, produces a\nsummary correctly highlighting its aim to \u201ccreate new regulations for cryptocurrencies, stable coins, and\nother digital money.\u201d If one continues the chat by claiming to be a \u201ccryptocurrency expert,\u201d Claude can\nreturn details about new reporting requirements introduced in the bill.\n\nThe ability for these tools to\ntailor information based on user knowledge provides an opportunity for citizens to engage with the\nlegislative process in a more transparent and efficient way.\n\nLLMs could also enhance voter learning in electoral settings.\n\nVoting advice applications (VAAs) have\nbecome ubiquitous in the US and Europe.\n\nVAAs solicit voters\u2019 stances across several issues and match\nvoters to politically congruent candidates.\n\nThough previous research has found positive effects on voter\nturnout and vote choice , VAAs assume that voters possess stable issue preferences, and might appeal to\nthose who are already politically engaged.\n\nIntegrating genai into the development of VAAs could\nallow lower propensity voters to pose simple questions about political parties (e.g., \u201cwhere does the\nRepublican Party stand on abortion?\u201d) and receive information about party positioning within seconds.\n\nInstead of responding to an extensive list of policy items, as is the case with existing VAAs, genai-guided\nconversations could help make interacting with VAAs less intimidating and more accessible to a broader\nspectrum of voters.\n\nIn implementing tools such as VAAs or even summarizing policies, a natural question is whether LLMs\nwill be \u201cbiased\u201d toward certain viewpoints.\n\nMethods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can be\nused to mitigate these concerns by grounding the generation of content in a variety of sources that span\nthe political spectrum.\n\nWhen a user interacts with an LLM, RAG ensures that relevant sources are\nfetched from a preloaded database, inserted into the prompt, and used to populate the answer.\n\nIt is\npossible to load an external database with sources such as party platforms and instruct the LLM to only\nsummarize the information contained in those sources.\n\nThis produces outputs that are generally free of\neditorializing and accurately represent the source material.\n\n-----\n\nOutside of electoral settings, extensions of RAG could be used to help voters learn about topics\ndiscussed in city council meetings, scour publicly available but underutilized civic data, and understand\nlocal policies.\n\nUsing RAG is akin to using a search engine that retrieves relevant information and\nsummarizes it in an accessible fashion.\n\nThis makes it an ideal method for simplifying vast amounts of\ndata, which can be useful for voters making choices in political contexts where knowledge is limited due\nto a lack of media coverage.\n\nFor example, one could use RAG to summarize recent approvals of housing\ndevelopments or a list of policies considered by a city council in the previous week.\n\nBeyond political learning, genai could also be used to facilitate communication between citizens\nand elected officials.\n\nWriting to lawmakers can be an intimidating process for many citizens, as they\nmight know how to articulate their concerns or they may be unsure about the relevant norms for such\ncommunication.\n\nLLMs can improve this process by enabling citizens to craft more persuasive messages.\n\nThey can also provide real-time assistance with respect to grammar, style, and tone, allowing citizens to\ncommunicate more effectively.\n\nIn the future, these tools may also be used by legislators to proactively\nidentify common concerns among citizens, further improving responsiveness.\n\ngenai could also help level the playing field with respect to political campaigns.\n\nUnder-resourced\ncampaigns may face challenges in creating content that appeals to voters.\n\nGenerative image and text\ntools can enable these campaigns to draft more compelling speeches, press releases, social media posts,\nand other materials.", "Generative image and text\ntools can enable these campaigns to draft more compelling speeches, press releases, social media posts,\nand other materials.\n\nThese methods can also be used to create tailored materials for different\naudiences.\n\nTo the extent that genai allows financially constrained campaigns to maintain a\nveneer of professionalism, it could reduce imbalances between lesser-known candidates and more\nestablished politicians.\n\nIn sum, although negative use cases involving genai have received significant media attention,\nthere are positive use cases that could enhance civic engagement and education.\n\nFrom powering\npolitical information-retrieving chat bots to improving citizen-to-legislator communication, the\nsummarization and style transfer capabilities of LLMs could be used to improve democratic processes.\n\nEncouraging the public to use these tools to productively cut through the morass of everyday politics\ncan serve as a powerful counterweight to misinformation, whether human or genai-generated.\n\n_Recommendations and Best Practices_\n\n-  Encourage campaigns, journalistic outlets, and technology companies to create pathways that\n\nhelp voters to use genai to summarize complex policies and political platforms.\n\n-  Political parties, technology companies, and civic organizations should help under-resourced\n\ncampaigns learn to use genai tools to generate higher quality and more informative content.\n\n-  Lawmakers and other actors should create pathways for citizens to use genai tools to communicate\n\ndirectly with their offices.\n\n-----", "**Information Centralization**\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that the genai market is likely to end up concentrated in the hands of a\nsmall number of dominant firms who build and deploy foundation models\u2014the large, flexible models\nthat can be used for a wide variety of applications.\n\nTo the extent that genai tools end up\nclustered in a small number of large tech platforms, it may further exacerbate concerns that tech\ncompanies have too much power over the information environment.\n\nAlready, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and other tech companies offering genai-related services have faced\nconcerns over what content their chatbots and other genai tools will and won\u2019t countenance,\nwith some critics worrying that the tools will say offensive things, while others worry that the generative\nAIs exhibit a left-wing political bias.\n\nMore generally, there are hard questions about (a) what content is\nallowed to enter a mode\u2019s training algorithms, (b) what prompts users are permitted to ask and which\nare rejected for being offensive, dangerous, or otherwise off limits, and (c) what output the tools will\nand won\u2019t provide.\n\nAs genai use expands, the power these companies have over these rules could become\nproblematic in much the same way that the power of social media companies over online speech has\nover the past 10 years.\n\nThere are two main risks.\n\nFirst, companies could err, and create content guardrails that are unfair,\nbiased, or confusing in ways that perturb the information environment.\n\nSecond, people might further lose trust in the information environment, concluding that big tech\ncompanies who don\u2019t share their values are unduly influencing what ideas are generated or gain\nwidespread distribution.\n\nIn the US, these concerns could come from both sides of the ideological\nspectrum.\n\nJust as we\u2019ve seen with regards to social media, the right will worry that genai tools\nare biased against conservative ideas and values, while the left will worry that these tools are biased\ntowards conservative ideas and values.\n\nThese concerns rest on the widespread use of genai and so may not come to fruition before the\n2024 election.\n\nIndeed, currently, polling shows that there is bipartisan support among Americans for a\nvariety of interventions by government and industry to reduce the risk that genai poses to\nelections.\n\nHowever, it is entirely possible that public attitudes will polarize once Americans experience\ntheir first important \u201cgenai election\u201d in 2024.\n\nAs such, these concerns bear careful watching, and companies\nand society would be wise to think now about how to resist the centralization of information provision\nbefore the problem becomes more developed.\n\nThere are at least two potential ways to mitigate this issue.\n\nFirst, society could take steps to ensure that there are many providers of genai tooling, so that\nno one company has undue power over content generation guardrails.\n\nThis could include exploring\n\n\n-----\n\npolicies to prevent market concentration in the genai industry, and perhaps is a reason to be\ncautious about endorsing policies that envision restricting the set of companies licensed to provide\ngenai tools (though these policies may have other important benefits).\n\nSecond, genai platforms could avoid taking on this power over content moderation by giving\ndecision-making power concerning guardrails over to users, industry-level self-regulatory bodies, civilsociety based regulatory bodies, or other external stakeholders.\n\nAlready a number of companies have announced efforts along these lines.\n\nBuilding on their experiment\nwith the Oversight Board to make binding content decisions for the company, Meta has recently\nannounced a \u201c community forum \u201d concerning genai guardrails, in which users are randomly\nrecruited and paid to learn about, debate, and make recommendations concerning genai policy issues.\n\nOpenAI has announced funding for a similar exploration .\n\nMeanwhile, Anthropic has implemented an\neffort to develop a \u201c constitution \u201d through consultation with the community.\n\nWhile these efforts are interesting, they are still nascent.\n\nThe recruited users can only consider a small\nnumber of issues and, at most, make recommendations rather than binding decisions.\n\nFor these self\ngovernance efforts to reassure skeptical Republicans and Democrats that tech companies are not\nshaping the expression of values in society, users would have to be given substantially greater power\nover more issues, to make binding decisions on them, and to communicate these decisions to the public\nso that the public could understand that tech companies have truly given over this power.\n\nExpanding the\npower of self-governance institutions like these is difficult, though, due to the expense and the practical\nchallenges associated with recruiting and paying users to deliberate and decide.", "**Conclusion**\n\nWe have reviewed a number of essential ways that genai will affect the 2024 election, focusing\nboth on the ways that it threatens to disrupt the information environment and affect the outcome of\nthe election and voters\u2019 faith in the process itself, as well as the ways it can be used to inform voters and\nimprove democratic functioning.\n\nIf there is a single theme to our review, it is that voters, journalists, and everyone who cares about\nelections should regard claims about new technology with great skepticism.\n\nIn some instances, the\nthreat to the election is caused by genai itself\u2014such as latebreaking \u201cOctober surprises\u201d driven\nby highly persuasive fake information.\n\nPeople should be skeptical of these surprises given these threats,\nand they should find ways to seek out information verification from sources they trust.\n\nIn other instances, the threat is not from the

resource, Underlying Reasons for Academic Dishonesty ( one common reason students might use a tool like ChatGPT to cheat is because the\noverall workload expected of them seems excessive.\n\nWhat is considered excessive, of course, is relative.\n\nOne good way to measure the workload is\nby assuming that a student will take at least three times longer to accomplish a task than it would for a faculty member.\n\nRice University has also\nproduced a workload estimator ( that can be used to measure the time it might take a\nstudent to complete certain kinds of tasks.", "### Assignment Design: Short-Term Interventions\n\nTry running your assignment prompts through ChatGPT itself.\n\nIf you are finding the responses to be on par for what you would expect, make small\nchanges to make it more challenging for the tool to be used inappropriately, and plan for longer-term adjustments to how the technologies should\nbe engaged, if it all.\n\nRequire Recent References\n\nChatGPT is only able to use information prior to January 2023 in its responses.\n\nBy asking students to use current events, recent newspaper\nsources, or very recent academic articles, faculty can more reliably assume that the analysis will be the student\u2019s own.\n\nAdd Reflection to Assignment\n\nAsk students to provide a reflective essay in addition to the paper or exam itself.\n\nThe objective would be to allow students to show their thinking\nand provide explanations for why they made the content and stylistic choices they did.\n\nSometimes called \u201cexam wrappers\n( these reflections personalize each

Guidelines and\n\nConsiderations\n\nUpdated: January 24, 2024\n\nWondering if there is a specific Duke policy regarding genai generated\n\ncontent?\n\nYou have the discretion to define how, if, and when genai\n\nmay be used in your courses.\n\nHowever, the Duke Community Standard has\n\nbeen updated to include the unauthorized use of genai as a form of\n\ncheating.\n\nPlus, the Office of Undergraduate Education offers a syllabus\n\nlanguage menu that identifies considerations for writing an genai policy.\n\n(NetID\n\nlogin required).", "## Draft your own genai policy\n\nAll instructors should update their syllabi to include guidance on the use of\n\ngenai in their class.\n\nWe encourage faculty to thoughtfully consider\n\ntheir stance on genai use.\n\nIn this shift in higher education and the rapidly\n\nchanging genai market, standardized, one-size-fits-all, genai policies are not\n\nsustainable in the long term.\n\nThey may also not account for the varying\n\nstances instructors will take regarding genai use in their classrooms.\n\nFurthermore, because genai is becoming more ubiquitous, you\u2019ll need\n\nto consider your personal stance on genai in your own work, as well as in your\n\n\n-----\n\ngenai is or isn\u2019t allowed makes the rules clear for students and faculty if there are\n\nacademic integrity violations as well.\n\nThe following guidelines for developing an genai policy for your syllabus include\n\nexamples of genai policies from instructors, universities, and centers\n\nof teaching and learning.\n\nFor the most part, they have been curated from a\n\ncrowd-sourced document that we encourage you to explore on your own to\n\nfind genai policies developed by instructors in your field and represent your level\n\nof comfort with the use of genai.\n\nOther sources for sample policies are cited in\n\nthe text itself.", "## Do your homework\n\nKevin Gannon (Queens College in Charlotte) argues in an article titled \u201cShould\n\nI Write an genai Policy\u201d (NetID login required) that instructors should start with\n\nresearch into the topic before writing their policy.\n\nHe offers a list for\n\ninstructors of varied sources that provide a primer on the mechanics of\n\ngenai, pros and cons of genai use, and a grounding in how genai\n\ncan be incorporated into teaching.\n\nWe encourage you to try at least one genai tool.\n\nA good way to start\n\nexploring is to enter the prompts that you give students for an assignment\n\ninto the genai tool, and see what the tool returns.\n\nIt is important to learn how to\n\nwrite effective prompts and also explore existing prompt ideas .\n\nKeep an open\n\nand curious mindset when considering whether such tools could be helpful to\n\nsome or all of your students.", "## Share the rationale behind your policy\n\nAs you define your individualized genai syllabus statement, your reasoning\n\nshould be grounded in the intellectual work of the course, your discipline and\n\nyour understanding of critical thought.\n\nSome of the questions you might ask\n\nyourself are: What will students lose (or gain) by using genai in your\n\ncourse?\n\nWhat do you want students to understand about genai and their\n\nintellectual development?\n\nWe encourage you to explain the rationale for your\n\npolicies with your students and open a conversation about genai with them.\n\nBelow are three policy examples that detail the instructors\u2019 thinking behind\n\ntheir genai policy.\n\n-----\n\ntwo guiding principles in a course that will allow the use of genai: \u201c1) Cognitive\n\ndimension: Working with genai should not reduce your ability to think clearly.\n\nWe\n\nwill practice using genai to facilitate\u2014rather than hinder\u2014learning.\n\n2) Ethical\n\ndimension: Students using genai should be transparent about their use and make\n\nsure it aligns with academic integrity.\u201d\n\nLis Horowitz (Salem State University) shares a practical reason behind a zero\n\ntolerance policy for genai in their writing course.\n\n\u201cSince writing,\n\nanalytical, and critical thinking skills are part of the learning outcomes of this\n\ncourse, all writing assignments should be prepared by the student.\n\nDeveloping strong competencies in this area will prepare you for a\n\ncompetitive workplace.\n\nTherefore, genai-generated submissions are not\n\npermitted and will be treated as plagiarism.\u201d\n\nBy defining the idea of integrity, Megan McNamara (UC Santa Cruz) points out\n\nwhat is at stake when we talk about academic honesty and personal growth.\n\nAs she states, \u201cIntegrity \u2013 other people\u2019s perception of your word as true \u2013 is\n\none of the most valuable assets you can cultivate in life.\n\nBeing attentive to\n\nintegrity in academic settings allows others to trust that you have completed\n\nwork for which you are taking credit.\u201d Her course allows students to use genai in\n\nlimited ways and this rationale sets the foundation for this use.", "## Support genai literacy\n\nAlthough students may already use genai, it does not mean that they\n\nunderstand the limitations of the tool or how to use it properly.\n\nFor example, genai is a brand-new source for information and the\n\nrules for citation and the general use of genai are still under formation.\n\nIf you\n\nexplain to students how to cite content generated from genai sources it reduces\n\nthe cognitive load of students unsure of how to act within the Duke\n\nCommunity Standard and raise their awareness of what is at stake when\n\ninteracting to genai content.\n\nMost academic style guides have already formulated\n\ncitation practices for genai.\n\nMonash University has curated a list of the\n\nvarious genai citation formats .\n\nYou have the option to personalize your approach to citations.\n\nSome\n\neducators are instructing students to submit a transcript of the conversation\n\nwith genai as an appendix to their written work.\n\nAnother alternative\n\nmight be a reflective piece as a companion to an assignment, as Pam Harland\n\n(Plymouth State University) has done by providing guiding questions for\n\n\n-----\n\noutput for your submission?\u201d \u201cDid you ask follow-up questions?\u201d \u201cWhat did\n\nyou learn?\u201d\n\nAnother aspect of genai literacy is understanding the ethical use of genai and its\n\nlimitations.\n\nWhen students have information about the hallucinations, bias,\n\nand inaccuracies of genai, it underscores why genai is not a shortcut to\n\ngood results.\n\nEthan Mollick (Harvard\u2019s Wharton School) frames it this way,\n\n\u201c[d]on\u2019t trust anything it says.\n\nIf it gives you a number or fact, assume it is\n\nwrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another\n\nsource.\n\nYou will be responsible for any errors or omissions provided by the\n\ntool.\n\nIt works best for topics you understand.\u201d The library at University of\n\nNorthwestern St. Paul has a guide for students with an overview of genai\u2019s\n\nshortcomings, plus information on how to verify sources and double check genai\n\nresponses.", "## Define acceptable use\n\nIf you decide to allow genai as a tool for learning in your courses,\n\nclarify for your students the circumstances in which genai is allowable.\n\nKim Sydow\n\nCambell (University of Texas) offers an example policy that expands upon the\n\ntasks that students can ask genai to perform:\n\n\u201cBecause the effective use of genai (genai) tools is increasingly\n\nimportant to the work of technical communicators, their use is sometimes\n\nrequired or allowed in course assignments.\n\ngenai tools can support a content\n\ncreator during all phases of their work:\n\npre-writing: before content is created, writers can use some tools to\n\nresearch topics, collect genre samples, brainstorm ideas, craft\n\noutlines, etc.\n\ndrafting: some tools support the generation of content\n\nrevising: after content is generated, many tools aid writers in\n\nidentifying and altering style/tone, spelling, punctuation, grammar,\n\netc.\u201d\n\nFrom Howard University of Law, Howard Bruckner explains to students what\n\ntasks are acceptable and underscores the students\u2019 responsibilities for ethical\n\nuse.\n\n\u201cgenai tools can be invaluable for generating ideas, identifying\n\n\n-----\n\na topic.\n\nBut YOU must guide, verify and craft your work product; do not just\n\ncut and paste without understanding.\u201d\n\nYou may discover that if you allow students to engage with genai,\n\nspecific guidelines may need to accompany each assignment.", "## Explore the continuum of policies\n\nBelow are policy examples from the University of Delaware\u2019s Center for\n\nTeaching and Assessment of Learning, which distill the four basic approaches\n\nthat instructors can take in their syllabi .\n\nWe invite you to consider them as\n\nstarting points in your exploration of what your genai policy will be.\n\nUse prohibited\n\nStudents are not allowed to use advanced automated

each\n\nassignment without substantive assistance from others, including automated\n\ntools.\n\nUse only with acknowledgement\n\nStudents are allowed to use advanced automated tools (genai\n\nor machine learning tools such as ChatGPT or Dall-E 2) on assignments in this\n\ncourse if that use is properly documented and credited.\n\nFor example, text\n\ngenerated using ChatGPT-3 should include a citation such as: \u201cChat-GPT-3.\n\n(YYYY, Month DD of query).\n\n\u201cText of your query.\u201d Generated using OpenAI.\n\nMaterial generated using other tools should follow a\n\nsimilar citation

citation is required.", "## About genai detection software\n\nWe don\u2019t recommend genai detection software as a part of your genai policy for\n\nthree main reasons.\n\n1.\n\nThe products are unreliable.\n\nResearch on genai detection software from MIT\n\nhighlights the false positive and negative rates.\n\nOpenAI (the company behind\n\nChatGPT) withdrew its own detection software due to the software\u2019s\n\nunreliability.\n\n2.\n\nDetection software is biased against certain segments of learners, for\n\nexample non-native speakers, as research from Stanford shows.\n\n3.\n\nAs genai changes, detection software cannot keep up.\n\nIf you decide to use detection software, share that information with your\n\nstudents ahead of time.\n\nResults from the software should not be the only\n\nmeasure of whether students have cheated.\n\nStudents can be encouraged to\n\nuse detection software prior to handing in work to check for originality\n\n(although they should be warned of the limitations as well).\n\nAnother option is to craft a policy that warns students they will need to speak\n\nwith you and defend their work if plagiarism is suspected.\n\nAs Liza Long\n\n(College of Western Idaho) explains \u201c[i]f I suspect that you have used ChatGPT,\n\nand you have not included the required citation and reflection, then you will\n\nneed to meet with me either in person or

growing accessibility and sophistication\nof genai tools provides opportunities\nto develop human-like generated text and\nrich multimedia content in a way that has\nnot previously been possible.\n\nTo fully harness the potential of high quality\nand safe genai, schools will need to be\nsupported in understanding and appropriately\nmanaging a range of privacy, security and ethical\nconsiderations.\n\nRisk management should also\nbe appropriate for the potential consequences.\n\nThese consequences include the potential for errors\nand algorithmic bias in genai content; the\nmisuse of personal or confidential information;\nand the use of genai for inappropriate\npurposes, such as to discriminate against individuals\nor groups, or to undermine the integrity of student\nassessments.\n\nAppropriate and proportionate risk\nmanagement will require robust guidance and\npolicy, which the Framework aims to support.", "### About the Framework\n\nIn February 2023, Education Ministers agreed\nthat responding to the risks and harnessing\nopportunities for Australian schools and students\narising from genai technologies is a\nnational education priority.\n\nMinisters agreed\nto develop an evidence-informed, best practice\nframework for Australian schools.\n\nThe Framework was developed in consultation\nwith unions, teachers, students, industry,\nacademics, and parent and school representative\nbodies from all sectors.\n\nIt was developed by\nthe National genai in Schools Taskforce comprised\nof representatives from all jurisdictions, school\nsectors, and the national agencies - Educational\nServices Australia (ESA), Australian Curriculum,\nAssessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA),\n\n\nAustralian Institute for Teaching and School\nLeadership (AITSL), and Australian Education\nResearch Organisation (AERO).\n\nThe Framework aligns to existing national policies\nand goals.\n\nIt complements Australia\u2019s Artificial\nIntelligence Ethics Framework , and the two\nkey goals of The Alice Springs (Mparntwe)\nEducation Declaration : promoting equity and\nexcellence in education; and enabling all young\nAustralians to become confident and creative\nindividuals, successful lifelong learners, and\nactive and informed members of the community.\n\nAdditionally, the Framework aligns to the\nUnited Nations sustainable development goal #4 :\nEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education\nand promote lifelong learning opportunities for\nall.\n\nIt also aligns with the Safer Technologies for\nSchools (ST4S) initiative which aims to enhance\nthe security, privacy and online safety of software\nservices and applications commonly used in\nAustralian schools.\n\nAny policy development or amendments made to\nalign with the Framework should also consider the\nAustralian Professional Standards for Teachers\n(APST) , Privacy Act 1988 , Copyright Act 1968 ,\nthe eSafety Commissioner\u2019s Best Practice\nFramework for Online Safety Education , and\nAustralia\u2019s human rights protections.\n\nWhere\napplicable, policies developed in alignment\nwith the Framework must also meet existing\ngovernment commitments to incorporate\nIndigenous community partnerships and expert\nreviews.\n\nPolicies must also meet government\nobligations to ensure Indigenous communities\nhave access to locally relevant data and\ninformation as per Closing the Gap Priority\nReform 4 .", "### Australian Framework for genai\n\nin Schools\n\n\n\n|Principles|Guiding

research.\n\nThe task force consulted widely\nwith experts and stakeholders.\n\nThis report surveys the landscape of GenAI technologies, assesses\ntheir potential to impact research and education, identifies limitations and concerns, offers\nguidelines on the best use of GenAI, and proposes policies and administrative support structures.\n\nThe task force\u2019s key policy recommendations are as follows.\n\n-  **_Critical Embrace:_** **BU should not universally prohibit or restrict the use of GenAI tools.\n\n**\n\nRather, BU should critically embrace the use of GenAI, support genai literacy among faculty and\nstudents, supply resources needed to maximize GenAI benefits in research and education,\nand exercise leadership in helping faculty and students craft adaptive responses.\n\n-  **_Pedagogical Clarity:_** **GenAI policies adopted by any college, school, or departmental**\n\n**unit should be consistent with the University\u2019s policies and reflect the critical**\n**embrace of GenAI technology.\n\n** Consistent with academic freedom, individual instructors\nshould be free to define GenAI policies suited to the learning goals of their courses, and\nevery syllabus needs to state the instructor's GenAI policy.\n\nConsistent with citation\npractices, instructors and students should acknowledge use of GenAI tools.\n\n-  **_Academic Misconduct_** _:_ **BU should advise instructors to exercise caution when using**\n\n**GenAI detectors as evidence of GenAI use.\n\n** GenAI detector output should be regarded as\nonly one part of a wider evidence base in evaluating possible academic misconduct.\n\nIf used,\nGenAI detectors should be applied equally and fairly, and faculty should be aware of\nselection bias when applying GenAI detectors to specific suspected cases.\n\nAdvance notice\nshould be given in syllabi, including naming the specific detectors employed, so that\nstudents have an opportunity to use them also.\n\nInstructors need to be informed and\nsupported in using reliable and consistent detectors.\n\n-  **_Security and Privacy:_** **BU should adopt policies to prevent the inadvertent publicizing**\n\n**of sensitive or valuable information through uploading it to GenAI tools.\n\n**\n\n-  **_Centralized Decisions_** _:_ **BU should centralize decisions on GenAI tool acquisition and**\n\n**licensing** , on resourcing and personnel for supporting GenAI literacy and pedagogical\nreflection, and on administrative structures to ensure ongoing adaptive response to rapidly\ndeveloping GenAI technology.", "Further recommendations (Section 1) are organized in the following broad categories: (a) training\nand support for faculty and students in leveraging GenAI technology, (b) mitigating privacy and\nsecurity concerns associated with the use of GenAI, and (c) administrative structures for\nstreamlining BU processes and organizing resources associated with GenAI.\n\nThe report also offers\nbasic background information (Section 2), as well as analysis of GenAI use in research (Section 3),\nGenAI use in creating artifacts for writing, arts, and design (Section 4), and teaching, learning, and\nstudent professional development (Section 5).\n\nAlongside policy recommendations, the report\nsuggests best-practice guidelines for the appropriate use of GenAI tools, and for dealing with\ninappropriate use.\n\nIn addition to the report, the task force developed a set of resources to explore\nthe landscape of academic GenAI policies, available at the BU genai task force website .\n\n-----\n\n1.\n\nR ECOMMENDED P OLICIES\n\ngenai (GenAI) tools are evolving rapidly and so are policies and\nguidelines regulating their use.\n\nAcademic institutions are starting to adopt policies governing GenAI\nuse and common policy themes have emerged (see Appendix D and BU genai task force website for a\nsearchable repository and analysis of GenAI policies released by academic institutions).\n\nThe genai task\nforce\u2019s recommendations for (enforceable) policies at the University level, along with suggested\nguidelines for wise and productive use of GenAI tools, generally align with this emerging consensus.\n\n1.1.\n\nP RINCIPLES FOR G UIDING GenAI P OLICY R ECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe genai task force identified four important principles that should govern the use of GenAI:\nleadership, ownership, transparency, and excellence.\n\nThese principles have far-reaching\nimplications, which will be considered in the sections of this document: research (Section 3),\ncreating artifacts (Section 4), teaching, learning, and student professional development (Section 5).\n\n_Leadership:_\n\n-  BU should recognize that GenAI tools are revolutionizing the economic landscape.\n\nThe\nUniversity should lead the way in helping students and faculty adapt.\n\n-  Faculty and students should be supported to become literate about GenAI, competent in\nusing GenAI tools, critically aware of the shifting balance of advantages and disadvantages\nof GenAI tools, and flexible in thinking about pedagogical and research aims and methods.\n\n-  BU should support ethical awareness in faculty, student, and institutional appraisal of GenAI\ntools, incorporating ethical dimensions in every educational and strategic resource.\n\n_Ownership:_\n\n-  Faculty and students should assume full ownership and ultimate responsibility for their\nwork, including when that work leverages GenAI.\n\n-  Faculty should emphasize the importance of human oversight over any GenAI created\ncontent and ensure students are not heavily or solely relying on GenAI for their work.\n\nGenAI\ntools may produce false information; the responsibility rests with the user to authenticate\ncontent using other verified sources.\n\n-  Faculty decisions about GenAI usage by students should be evidence-based, and caution\nshould be used with GenAI detectors in any decision process.\n\n-  Authorship of a document implies that the author is responsible for the work.\n\nSince a\nsoftware tool cannot assume such responsibility, and consistent with policies put in place\nby academic publishers [1], [2], [3], GenAI tools should not be listed as co-authors of\ndocuments and creative works.\n\n_Transparency:_\n\n-  If genai tools are used in research, class assignments, writing, design, or other forms of creative\nwork, it is important to be transparent on how exactly the tool has been used.\n\n-----\n\n-  Scholars should be mindful that documentation and transparency requirements may not be\nthe same in all fields and journals, and that current requirements may change with the everevolving landscape.\n\n-  Faculty should be fully aware of and follow guidelines set forth by federal agencies and\nregulators (e.g., National Science Foundation guidelines [4]).\n\n-  Researchers should be aware of the individual genai practices and policies of those they\ncollaborate with, as well as vendors and subcontractors who are involved in the research\nprocess.\n\n-  Students should be transparent about their use of GenAI for course assignments and\nprojects and be instructed to document how GenAI tools were used.\n\n-  Instructors need to be transparent about course policies and address GenAI in every\nsyllabus, providing clear guidance to students on how GenAI may or may not be used.\n\nThey\nalso need to provide advance notice of detection strategies and enforcement of GenAI rules.\n\nFor example, the _CAS Writing Program_ , as part of their faculty genai literacy efforts , offers\nspecific language on their syllabus building tool for faculty to incorporate in course syllabi.", "For example, the _CAS Writing Program_ , as part of their faculty genai literacy efforts , offers\nspecific language on their syllabus building tool for faculty to incorporate in course syllabi.\n\nThe BU _Center for Teaching & Learning (CTL)_ also offers guidance on referencing GenAI on\ncourse syllabi on their Communicate with Students about genai resource.\n\n-  Transparency requires that authors need to cite the specific GenAI tool used in any\ndocument or product.\n\nStudents should be instructed and reminded to credit both human\nand GenAI contributors, and that every source used must be cited.\n\n-  Faculty should familiarize themselves with the different approaches for citing GenAI tools\nand guide students on how to credit GenAI.\n\nBU\u2019s CTL offers resources for \u201cCiting with genai\u201d on\ntheir Quick References for Teaching with genai resource page.\n\n_Excellence:_\n\n-  BU\u2019s commitment to excellence in research and teaching should be reasserted in connection\nwith GenAI tools.\n\nEvery application of such tools, regardless of context, should deepen the\nquality of teaching, learning, and research.\n\n-  Faculty and students should be trained in creative engineering of prompts to extract the\nmost profound outputs possible.\n\n-  GenAI outputs should be critically evaluated to improve the quality of research and\nteaching.\n\n-  GenAI use should be evaluated for conformity with University expectations about ethical\nand responsible computing.\n\nIn addition to the general policy recommendations mentioned in the Executive Summary, which are\nguided by these principles, we group specific additional recommendations in the following\ncategories: (1.2) training and support, (1.3) privacy and security, (1.4) guidelines for appropriate\nuse and for dealing with inappropriate use of GenAI tools, and (1.5) administrative\nrecommendations.\n\nWhen appropriate, we discuss the need for resources to implement the\nproposed recommendations.\n\n-----\n\n1.2.\n\nT RAINING AND S UPPORT\n\nGenAI tools will impact every field of study and most professions.\n\nIt is vital that we equip students\nand faculty to operate effectively in the emerging GenAI era.\n\nIt is likely that GenAI tools will\naccentuate disparities between those with the knowledge and resources to benefit from their use\nand the rest of the global population.\n\nBU, by properly educating its students, can help graduates\nmaintain competitive advantage in their future careers, while remaining acutely aware of equity\nchallenges.\n\nSimilarly, faculty can benefit by leveraging GenAI tools and BU should help educate\nthem.\n\nRecommendations follow.\n\n**_Incentivize the creation of new undergraduate and graduate courses or course modules_** **.\n\n**\nEveryone across the many disciplines represented at the University should have a basic\nunderstanding of GenAI technology so that they can better appreciate its benefits and limitations.\n\n-  University units should add courses that meet Hub requirements by focusing on GenAI tools\nand related applications.\n\n**_Support the development of GenAI literacy and education in best practices among faculty_** **.\n\n**\nGenAI, and genai more broadly, is likely to impact research in many domains, yet some faculty may\nlack the background or specialized training to benefit from these developments.\n\nThe more BU does\nto educate its faculty and support their work, the more it will benefit from their increased\nproductivity and impact in their fields.\n\nThis leads to several specific recommendations.\n\n-  For new research projects and collaborations, University-wide centers, such as the Hariri\n\nInstitute , should play an important role, enabling and supporting new research\ncollaborations through existing mechanisms (e.g., the Hariri Focused Research Programs ).\n\n-  Similar to facilitators for research computing and free allotments of computing resources at\nthe Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) for all faculty, we\nrecommend that BU considers funding positions of _AI research and education consultants_\n_and facilitators_ .\n\nSuch consultants could be made available to faculty to facilitate the use of genai\nand GenAI in their research.\n\nIf the consultation service is centralized, the Hariri _Software_\n_and Application Innovation Lab (SAIL)_ would be an appropriate place to house genai\nfacilitators.\n\n-  We recommend soliciting feedback from faculty about how GenAI is and is not assisting\nfaculty efforts to provide excellent education, thereby helping all to learn about the limits of\nGenAI.\n\n-  genai facilitators should be tasked to offer workshops to faculty and students on leveraging\nGenAI as research tools, introducing concepts such as prompt engineering, presenting case\nstudies from faculty who leveraged GenAI in their research, and providing information\nabout computing resources and software and how to access them.\n\n**_Instructors should be provided with support to help them incorporate GenAI into their courses._**\nThis leads to several specific recommendations.", "**_Instructors should be provided with support to help them incorporate GenAI into their courses._**\nThis leads to several specific recommendations.\n\n-  CTL and the Office of Digital Learning & Innovation (DL&I) should be BU\u2019s main vehicles for\nproviding teaching and course support.\n\nTheir GenAI offerings should be vetted by the body\nof GenAI ambassadors described below.\n\n-----\n\n-  CTL should continue to offer workshops on how to incorporate GenAI into classroom\ninstruction for those who are interested.\n\n-  CTL should continue to provide guidelines and resources in its genai in the Classroom and\n\nTeaching and Learning in an genai World web sites.\n\n-  DL&I and CTL should produce self-paced online modules to educate faculty.\n\n-  DL&I and CTL should establish _GenAI faculty ambassadors_ across campus to act as\nschool/college experts and to provide local advice.\n\nThese can be drawn from the ranks of\nthe faculty in each corresponding unit.\n\nThis body of local ambassadors should exchange\nnotes and identify best practices.\n\n-  GenAI faculty ambassadors should act as a faculty body for CTL and DL&I in evaluating and\napproving their online offerings, similar to how a regular course is evaluated and approved\nby a department\u2019s and a college\u2019s faculty.\n\nCTL and DL&I should establish mechanisms to\ncollect user feedback on their offerings and use it for continuous improvement.\n\n-  BU should consider establishing a seed-funding program to provide modest and timelimited grants to faculty who have innovative ideas on using or analyzing GenAI in their\nteaching, particularly if they are willing to make their innovations more broadly available to\nother faculty who want to test such ideas.\n\nOne potential mechanism is to leverage the genai and\nEducation Initiative at the Hariri Institute which has introduced such a seed-funding\nprogram in collaboration with DL&I.\n\n1.3.\n\nP RIVACY AND S ECURITY\n\nThere exist serious privacy and security concerns associated with using GenAI tools running on\nservers that reside in corporate data centers.\n\nFor this reason, many scientific journals have\nintroduced policies against the uploading of papers under review, and funding agencies, such as the\nNational Science Foundation (NSF), have banned the uploading of proposals under review.\n\nThese concerns apply to GenAI tools ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini (formerly Bard), and Llama, among\nothers, when one uses the company\u2019s website and resources to run the model.\n\nThese companies can\nuse the provided data from users to train the next generation of the models.\n\nThus, it becomes\npossible for information to be leaked through future model generations.\n\nIn contrast, some models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) can be downloaded and run locally.\n\nIn this case, all\ninteractions with the model and content provided to the model are stored locally and the user\nmaintains ownership and control.\n\nWe recommend:\n\n-  BU should adopt policies against uploading documents such as personnel files, budget\nspreadsheets with identifying information, exams, homework papers and solutions, medical\nrecords, tenure letters, and any document that contains personal information that should\nnot be made public through server-based GenAI tools.\n\n-  University offices should implement policies to train all employees, including student\nemployees, about this policy and their associated responsibilities.\n\n-  Independent Review Board (IRB) outcome letters and Data Use Agreements (DUAs) should\nbe modified to include a provision affirming non-disclosure to GenAI servers.\n\n-----\n\n-  This policy can be reevaluated only when corporate assurances about not using prompts for\ntraining purposes are authoritatively audited.\n\n1.4.\n\nG UIDELINES FOR D EALING WITH I NAPPROPRIATE U SE OF GenAI\n\nIn the past, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration for assignments, and other violations of\nacademic integrity have been relatively easy to detect (e.g., by comparing an assignment with the\nsource).\n\nDetecting the illegitimate use of GenAI tools is challenging by comparison.\n\nGenAI detectors\nare not fully reliable and may provide different answers for the same query at different times (see\nAppendix C).\n\nThis is likely to remain an issue, particularly for cases where there is human-GenAI\ncollaboration.\n\nThis leads to several recommendations.\n\n-  **_Promote faculty literacy about GenAI detectors_** **.\n\n** Faculty and disciplinary committees\n\nshould be informed of the unreliability and inconsistency of GenAI detectors and be advised\nthat a likelihood score produced by GenAI detectors should not be considered sufficient\nevidence to accuse a student of unauthorized GenAI use.\n\nOn the other hand, taken together\nwith other factors, it may be considered as a relevant piece of evidence to strengthen a case.\n\n-  **_Promote faculty consistency in the use of GenAI detectors_** **.\n\n** In view of the unreliability of\n\nGenAI detectors, faculty should adopt a uniform policy on the application of detection tools.", "** In view of the unreliability of\n\nGenAI detectors, faculty should adopt a uniform policy on the application of detection tools.\n\nIf a faculty member chooses to systematically employ a detection tool on submitted\nassignments, the specific tool should be applied to the assignments of all students.\n\nFaculty\nshould be aware of selection bias that could be introduced by applying GenAI detectors to a\nspecific targeted subset of students.\n\n-  **_Promote faculty literacy about GenAI methods to hide plagiarism_** **.\n\n** GenAI tools may make\n\nit harder to detect plagiarism, as users can use GenAI to \u201cparaphrase\u201d from an original\nsource.\n\nCTL offers guidance on genai and Academic Integrity and this guidance should be kept\ncurrent with developments in the field.\n\nWe recommend that IS&T evaluates various options\nfor tools to enhance plagiarism detection, including licensing tools that are successfully\nused by academic publishers (e.g., iThenticate [5], Grammarly [6]).\n\nThe task force heard\nfrom both faculty and students that the Blackboard solution (Turnitin) is ineffective at\npresent.\n\n1.5.\n\nA DMINISTRATIVE R ECOMMENDATIONS\n\nFinally, the genai task force offers the following administrative recommendations.\n\n-  **_GenAI should be leveraged to improve, automate, and streamline a variety of BU_**\n\n**_processes_** **.\n\n** Whereas for business functions (e.g., Q&A for HR benefit options) commercial\nsolutions are likely to emerge quickly, student advising may be a function where GenAI\ncould help students conveniently discover information regarding courses, instructors,\ngraduation requirements, and processes.\n\nWe recommend that the University explores the\ntraining of a BU native chatbot for these purposes, either by leveraging BU faculty expertise\nor partnering with an external provider.\n\nSuch a chatbot would help students quickly find\nanswers to many administrative questions, reduce the burden on staff and faculty in large\nacademic programs, and establish a productive collaboration between advising staff and\n\n\n-----\n\nchatbot assistants.\n\nThis is meant not to reduce faculty-student advising interactions, but\nrather to reduce the time devoted to procedural issues and increase the time for more\nmeaningful exchanges.\n\n-  **_BU should centralize decisions on recommending and licensing GenAI tools for faculty_**\n\n**_and students_** **.\n\n** Some existing tools (e.g., OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT) offer a subscription service for\nthe most advanced version of the tool.\n\nA paid service can lead to a \u201cdigital divide\u201d that\nintensifies inequities between students and groups with the resources to pay for\nsubscriptions and those who lack such resources.\n\nGenAI tools are likely to become\nubiquitous and necessary for work, so BU should implement a policy similar to what it is\nnow using for commonly used software (e.g., office productivity, operating systems, Matlab,\nstatistical, and other scientific and design software).\n\n-  **_BU should create a centralized resource of GenAI information_** **.\n\n** BU should consider\n\ncreating a centralized website to communicate the University\u2019s policies and procedures\nregarding GenAI, and to provide links to various resources offered by BU offices, such as\nIS&T, CTL, DL&I, and any new resources that may be created as a result of these\nrecommendations (e.g., genai research facilitators, genai ambassadors, the web-based app\ncontaining information on policies adopted elsewhere, etc.).\n\nThis website needs a manager\nto coordinate the various offices and resources and to ensure that content gets updated to\nreflect rapid developments in the GenAI landscape.\n\nAn initial web site was set up by the BU\ngenai task force.\n\n-----\n\n2.\n\nB ACKGROUND\n\n2.1.\n\nGenAI I NTRODUCTION\n\nGenAI generally refers to foundational genai models that have been trained on vast amounts of data\nand can generate new content.\n\nAppendix A offers technical background on the evolution of the\n_Natural Language Processing (NLP)_ field that gave rise to the recent _Large Language Models (LLMs),_\nsuch as OpenAI\u2019s popular ChatGPT [7].\n\nThe latest GPT version (as of the writing of this report), GPT4, has been trained on vast amounts of text (from the internet, books, news articles, scientific\nliterature, etc.\n\n), yielding models with over 1.7 trillion parameters.\n\nBeyond text generation, models\n(such as OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E [8]) can generate images based on a text description.\n\nThe GenAI landscape is rapidly changing.\n\nThere are hundreds of GenAI tools and more appear every\nweek.\n\nPopular GenAI tools designed to generate text include: Microsoft\u2019s Copilot (formerly\nBingChat) [9] (based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4), Google\u2019s Gemini (formerly Bard) [10], [11], Meta\u2019s Llama\n\n[12], Mistral [13], and Anthropic\u2019s Claude [14].", "Text-based tools can be prompted to write many\nforms of text (including creative writing), edit text, write computer code in many programming\nlanguages, offer counseling services, function as tutors, automate call centers, and create interactive\nrobotic companions.\n\nThere are countless other GenAI tools for text creation, many of them with no\ncontent moderation, which the better-known offerings do have.\n\nHundreds of text generators for\nspecialized applications are now being offered by OpenAI, based on GPT-4, and many GenAI tools\nare being created based on the foundational GenAI models mentioned earlier.\n\nGenAI tools can also produce other forms of output, including images and visual art (e.g., at the time\nof this report, OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E [8], Midjourney [15], Stable Diffusion [16], Adobe Firefly [17]),\nmusic (e.g., Soundraw [18], Bandlab [19]), video (e.g., Pictory [20], Synthesys [21], Sora [22]), and\npresentations (e.g., Simplified [23], Slides genai [24], Gamma [25]).\n\nThe latest versions of GenAI tools (including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Gemini) can handle\nmulti-modal input and output, including text, images, various file types (e.g., spreadsheets,\npresentations, data files), and audio/video in the case of Gemini.\n\nWe expect these capabilities to\nbecome more sophisticated, more integrated, and more broadly applicable very rapidly.\n\n2.2.\n\nT HE N ATURE OF GenAI M ODELS\n\nUnderstanding the nature of the models underlying GenAI tools is important for informing their\nwise and effective use.\n\nThe following terms and associated characteristics are relevant to every part\nof this report.\n\n-  _GenAI Output:_ The output of GenAI models is _probabilistic_ and not deterministic.\n\nSpecifically,\n\nthe model learns to associate a probability to different outputs and essentially \u201ctosses a\ncoin\u201d to generate the most likely output given the input.\n\nThe same prompt, repeated several\ntimes, can produce different outputs.\n\n-  _GenAI Inaccuracy:_ GenAI models are known to _hallucinate_ , state falsehoods, generate\n\nplausible but non-existing references, etc.\n\nThus, one should use the output with extreme\ncaution and always fact-check.\n\n-----\n\n-  _GenAI Modalities:_ The latest GenAI models can handle _multi-modal_ input and produce multi-\n\nmodal output, including text, data formatted in various formats, images, audio, video,\npresentation slides, computer code, etc.\n\n-  _GenAI Web Searching:_ Chatbots powered by GenAI models can search the web for answers,\n\nhelpfully integrating and summarizing information.\n\nGenAI models also generate answers to\nquestions that fuse the model\u2019s output with information they obtain from web searches.\n\n-  _GenAI Opacity:_ No one understands exactly what these models do, not even their developers.\n\nIt is currently impossible to explain precisely why a complex model having 1.7 trillion\nparameters produces a specific answer.\n\n-  _GenAI Attribution:_ LLM models \u201crecall\u201d the information on which they have been trained to\n\ngenerate responses to queries, and they can do so without always attributing the source.\n\nThis can lead to plagiarism, even though the models are not trained to plagiarize.\n\n-  _GenAI Prompts:_ The way one asks a GenAI chatbot a question is important, and different\n\nprompts may yield different answers.\n\nSeveral techniques have been shown to improve the\nquality of GenAI tools\u2019 output.\n\n_Prompt engineering_ , i.e., creating prompts to elicit high\nquality answers, is an active field of research.\n\nExamples of prompt engineering include: (a)\nFew-shot learning, in which the model is given example questions and desirable answers as\npart of the prompt; (b) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [26], which asks the GenAI\nmodel to explain its reasoning before providing an answer; and (c) ensembling, i.e., asking\nthe same question multiple times and taking a majority vote to determine the answer,\nwhich can compensate for the stochastic operation of GenAI chatbots.\n\n-  _GenAI Training:_ For the most part, the big tech companies developing GenAI models have\n\nnot made the datasets used for training public, which makes it difficult to determine what\naspects of model behavior are due to specific properties of the training data (e.g., bias).\n\nFor\nexample, models have been found to know details about characters in copyrighted books, so\nauthors have sued some of the companies who developed the models for copyright\ninfringement.\n\nOn a larger scale, news organizations such as _The New York Times_ (NYT) [27]\nhave mounted legal action against OpenAI and Microsoft (which has invested heavily in\nOpenAI) for unauthorized use of NYT content in training OpenAI\u2019s GPT models.\n\n-  _GenAI Costs:_ Training GenAI models (e.g., involving as much as 1.7 trillion parameters)\n\nrequires vast datasets (reportedly, more than 10 trillion words in 45 GB of data) and a large\nnumber of GPU servers.", "OpenAI estimated that the cost of training GPT-4 was on the order\nof $100 million [28], which suggests that only large corporations with ample financial and\ncomputing resources can train such large foundational models, and such training involves\nsignificant ecological impacts.\n\nUniversity-based researchers, and even collaborations\nbetween universities cannot easily compete with commercial enterprises in constructing\nsuch large artifacts.\n\n-  _GenAI Privacy:_ Popular models such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini (formerly\n\nBard) are _not_ open source.\n\nThe code for the model and the model itself (embodied in the\nneural network weights) reside on servers controlled by these companies.\n\nThis implies that\nthe company running a model can still see and reuse interactions with the model.\n\nFor\nexample, the text of a query submitted to ChatGPT is saved by OpenAI and could be used to\ntrain future generations of the model.\n\nHence, there is a real danger that future model\n\n\n-----\n\nresponses may leak private or confidential or otherwise valuable information through\nresponses to queries.\n\nWhile settings can instruct GenAI models not to use information\nsubmitted for training future models, and new services promising confidentiality are being\nrolled out [29], these corporate representations have not been independently audited or\nverified.\n\nSimilarly, there is no independent verification of the processes used to train the\nmodels, their safety, their ability to preserve privacy, etc.\n\nThe federal government has\nissued an executive order seeking to highlight such concerns and instructing federal\nagencies to take steps to regulate this nascent industry [30].\n\nCurrently, among the recent\nvery large LLMs, Meta\u2019s Llama [12] and Mistral\u2019s Mistral [13] are partially open source, in\nthe sense that one can download, install, and run a local copy of the model, which\nguarantees that no information submitted through a query could be passed to the\ncorporation that developed and trained the model.\n\nStill, Meta has not released the dataset\nused to train the model, retaining some opacity and making the model not fully open source\nand reproducible [31].\n\n-  _GenAI Moderation:_ Large tech companies have invested in creating a content moderation\n\nlayer for their GenAI tools to inhibit the generation of offensive content.\n\nThese content\n_guardrails_ can often be surmounted with clever jailbreak techniques [32], [33], [34].\n\nMany\nchatbots have little or no content moderation.\n\n-  _GenAI Disinformation:_ GenAI tools, particularly those without content moderation, can be\n\nused by bad actors to generate and disseminate disinformation, and in a convincing way\nthat inspires others to spread it further, not realizing that it is false.\n\nThis can potentially\ndestabilize political and public institutions and provoke security problems.\n\n-  _GenAI Psychology:_ We are still learning about the psychological impact of GenAI tools, but at\n\nthis point they appear to have the potential for significant effects, from failure to develop\ncritical skills in thinking, reading, writing, and coding, to the atrophy of those same skills.\n\nUsed wisely, they can help refocus attention on the more creative aspects of problems,\nincluding human-to-human skills in reasoning critically and empathically, and extend\ncognitive reach to an unprecedented degree, which has the potential to make them vital\nassets for learning, teaching, and research.\n\n-  _GenAI Detectors:_ Detectors can estimate the likelihood of a passage being created by a GenAI\n\ntool (e.g., GPTZero [35] provides assessments for GPT-4, Llama 2, and human + genai working\ntogether to write a passage), but these assessments _simply report a probability_ .\n\nUsing them\ncan generate both false positives and false negatives, which complicates evaluation of\nacademic misconduct charges.\n\nThey may also be inconsistent, in the sense that the same\nquery may yield different results, which makes it difficult for students and faculty to use\ndetectors to protect themselves against the nightmare of academic misconduct charges\nbased on false positives.\n\nIn addition, these detectors have been known to be especially\nbiased towards non-native speakers of English due to these speakers\u2019 possibly restricted\nlinguistic diversity and word choice [36].\n\nCurrently, there is no definitive way to assess with\nhigh confidence that a passage was written by or with the help of GenAI, or for students and\ngraders to receive the same originality estimate.\n\nThe accompanying study of the accuracy\nand consistency of GenAI chatbots (see Appendix C) illustrates the problem.\n\n-----\n\n2.3.", "The accompanying study of the accuracy\nand consistency of GenAI chatbots (see Appendix C) illustrates the problem.\n\n-----\n\n2.3.\n\nE THICS C ONCERNS S URROUNDING GenAI T OOLS\n\nGenAI tools have sparked a range of ethical concerns, including:\n\n-  using work of others for training, and the associated possible copyright infringement;\n\n-  low-paid workers for model training based on human feedback [37], [38] and traumatic\nexposure of low-paid content moderators to horrific material;\n\n-  output mimicking styles of human creators;\n\n-  deep-fake audio and video used to spread disinformation, from political campaigns to\ncyberbullying;\n\n-  violation of privacy and security expectations;\n\n-  economic disruption through job displacement;\n\n-  climate impacts due to the massive server farms that train and run widely used GenAI tools\n\n[39];\n\n-  inequities of access.\n\nSuch ethical quandaries are arising within a legal and policy vacuum, forcing lawmakers to adapt\nquickly, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions with harmful side effects until more stable\npolicies, regulations, and laws are enacted.\n\nA fundamental unresolved issue is the lack of sufficiently thoroughgoing ethical review within and\nof technology corporations, which often aim to \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d rather than be clear\nwith regulators and the general public about the predictable socioeconomic implications of new\ntechnologies.\n\nWith that in mind, BU should consider strengthening guidelines for responsible conduct of research\nand implementing a mechanism for ethics review of research projects involving genai, much as BU\ncurrently uses an institutional review board to oversee human-subjects research.\n\n-----\n\n3.\n\nG EN genai IN R ESEARCH\n\nThe promise of GenAI tools in research is considerable, as are the challenges.\n\nBecause of the rapid\npace of this field, it is likely that some points below will be outdated soon after this report is\nreleased.\n\nThus, our preliminary recommendations will need to be revised in the months and years\nahead.\n\nSome researchers at BU focus on developing and applying GenAI tools, while others may use GenAI\ntools for research on any number of topics.\n\nIn both cases, it is important to enable BU researchers to\nuse GenAI to advance their research and to address major societal challenges, while also mitigating\nany problems that may result.\n\nWe must harness these technologies but do so cautiously.\n\nIn addition to training established scholars in using GenAI tools to advance their research, we\nshould also integrate GenAI training into the education of graduate and undergraduate researchers.\n\n3.1.\n\nGenAI U SAGE S URVEY\n\nTo understand where our community stands in the evolving place of GenAI tools in research, we\nsurveyed 15 associate deans for research across BU\u2019s schools and colleges (see Appendix B).\n\nWe\nreceived responses from eight (53% response rate).\n\nWe asked the associate deans seven openended questions on topics ranging from the value and challenges of GenAI tools in research, to\nwhether BU should have guidelines concerning GenAI tools in research.\n\nThe associate deans echoed\nperspectives found in news coverage and in the limited extant scholarly work, including a recent\nworkshop by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [40] on the topic.\n\nGenAI tools in research, according to the associate deans, can help scholars develop literature\nreviews, formulate hypotheses, aid data collection and analysis, make coding easier and faster, and\nprovide editing and proofreading assistance.\n\nOn the downside, the associate deans suggested that\ngenai can lead to greater reliance on pattern recognition without understanding, and this, in turn, can\nlead to biased results.\n\nIn addition, GenAI tools may facilitate the proliferation of misinformation,\nmake plagiarism harder to detect, and raise challenges for intellectual property protection.\n\nFinally,\nseveral of our respondents suggested that BU researchers could benefit from training workshops of\nvarious sorts, and the majority favored the review and development of updated guidelines for\nresponsible conduct of research at BU.\n\n3.2.\n\nB ENEFITS AND C ONCERNS R ELATING TO GenAI IN R ESEARCH\n\nConsidering the survey results, perspectives from the genai task force and its consultants, and other\npolicy and advice documents for higher education (see Appendix D), we note the following benefits\nof GenAI tools for research.\n\n-  _Natural Language Processing:_ GenAI tools can facilitate and simplify natural-language\n\nprocessing (NLP), especially of text, including extracting information from text;\ncomprehending, analyzing, and summarizing passages; conducting thematic keyword\nidentification in automated qualitative research pipelines; performing sentiment analysis;\ntranslating between multiple languages; and encoding text for downstream classification\n\n\n-----\n\ntasks.", "For example, the analysis of GenAI policy documents on the task force\u2019s website is a\nfully automated application of GenAI to hundreds of complex texts (see Appendix D).\n\n-  _Human-Computer Interaction:_ GenAI tools can automate human-machine interactions,\n\nincluding in Q&A tasks.\n\nFor example, specialized chatbots can automate data collection from\nhuman subjects for clinical trials.\n\n-  _Literature Review:_ GenAI tools can automate literature review by analyzing a large range of\n\nscholarly papers and through intelligent human prompting, identify the more relevant\nsubset of publications for subsequent analysis.\n\n(See Appendix E for a description of a case\nstudy.)\n\n-  _Tech Support:_ GenAI tools can automate technical-support activities by answering technical\n\nquestions and providing instructions on how to perform a plethora of computer-related and\nother tasks.\n\n-  _Coding:_ GenAI tools can generate computer code in almost any programming language,\n\ngreatly accelerating and simplifying tedious and time-consuming computer-programming\ntasks.\n\n-  _Disciplinary applications:_ GenAI tools have started to be used in various scientific fields.\n\nExamples include: aiding healthcare and disease diagnosis [41], [42], [43], robotics [44],\n\n[45], material science and chemistry [46], social sciences [47], and even automated\nhypothesis generation for scientific discovery, leading to automated laboratories.\n\nAs GenAI\nmodels improve, they are likely to be able to reason better, to the point that they can\nanalyze legal arguments and construct complex mathematical proofs [48].\n\nGenAI tools can\ncompose text for scholarly papers, presentations, proposals, and other documents; take\ninterpretative summary minutes in meetings, when coupled with automatic speech\nrecognition; edit and improve text; generate illustrative graphics; and generate drafts of\npresentations [49].\n\nAn expansive survey [50] outlines genai research directions for science,\nenergy, and security.\n\nGenAI tools also raise concerns in research contexts:\n\n-  _Overuse:_ GenAI tools may lead to atrophy of human generative skills due to overuse or\n\ninattentive use in the writing of proposals, reports, papers, and presentations.\n\n-  _Bias:_ GenAI tools can accentuate biases present in training data, expressing such biases in\n\ntext output.\n\n-  _Privacy:_ GenAI tools introduce privacy concerns when uploading confidential information to\n\nGenAI engines (e.g., proposals or papers under review, identifiable information about\nresearch subjects, personnel files, or private personal information).\n\n-  _Responsible conduct of research:_ GenAI tools make it easier to violate research ethics and\n\nharder to detect such violations (e.g., plagiarism, generate fictitious data, manipulate\nimages, etc.).\n\n3.3.\n\nE XISTING G UIDELINES\n\nSeveral universities, including R1 institutions, have already published guidelines for the use of\nGenAI tools in research (see Appendix D).\n\nAt the same time, publishers have issued guidelines on\nthe use of GenAI tools by reviewers and authors, generally prohibiting uploading papers under\n\n\n-----\n\nreview to GenAI tools to preserve confidentiality, prohibiting listing GenAI tools as co-authors, and\nrequiring authors to disclose the use of GenAI in the manuscript and cite the corresponding tools\n\n[1], [2], [3].\n\nNSF has also adopted similar guidelines for reviewers and proposers [4].\n\nThe National\nInstitutes of Health has adopted guidance on the use of GenAI in grant reviews [51].\n\n-----\n\n4.\n\nG EN genai IN C REATING A RTIFACTS : W RITING , A RTS , AND D ESIGN\n\nGenAI has become commonplace in creating artifacts, including but not limited to areas that\nincorporate an iterative invention and revision process such as writing, designing, and creating art.\n\nBU should support GenAI not as a replacement for the process of creation, but rather as a\ncollaborative tool.\n\nGenAI tools can be effective in these areas if integrated with human oversight,\nand if students are taught how to use them appropriately and responsibly.\n\nWriting a paper or creating any form of art is often viewed in terms of the final artifact.\n\nHowever, a\nprocess-driven approach emphasizes the formation, development, and refinement of ideas,\neventually yielding a final product.\n\nIn this framework, GenAI tools can be useful assistants and\ncollaborators for generating initial ideas, clarifying thoughts, acting as peer reviewers, and iterating\nthrough many versions.\n\n4.1.\n\nB EST P RACTICES FOR I NCORPORATING GenAI IN C REATION OF A RTIFACTS\n\nBy thoughtfully designing assignments that incorporate and emphasize process rather than only\nthe end-result, faculty can ensure that students not only are able to make sound decisions regarding\nthe use of GenAI tools, but also become proficient in using these tools when needed by remaining\nactively engaged in the process of _creating artifacts_ , honing their critical thinking and originality.", "This approach prepares students for a future where GenAI tools are an integral part of the creative\nlandscape, without diminishing the importance of human insight and creativity.\n\n-  _Teaching Students about GenAI-Assisted Artifacts:_ Incorporating or _not incorporating_ GenAI\n\ntools into the iterative creative processes requires a nuanced understanding from both\nfaculty and students.\n\nFaculty can guide students in understanding how GenAI tools can\nserve as a part of their creative toolkit in courses that incorporate writing or designing,\nemphasizing its _supplementary_ role rather than a substitute for human creativity, while also\ndemonstrating GenAI\u2019s limitations.\n\nThis will foster an genai literacy that appreciates GenAI\ntools only as a potential _partner_ or _assistant_ in writing and other creative activities.\n\nThis\nlevel of literacy, for example, may involve demonstrations on how GenAI tools can suggest\ndiverse design layouts or writing styles, or be used as a starting point for creative\nexploration, thereby _enhancing_ the creative process.\n\nMeanwhile, educating students about\nthe limitations of GenAI tools in these creative processes is also crucial.\n\nThis can be\nachieved through case studies and examples where GenAI tools have failed to capture the\nnuances of human communication and creativity, or have produced outputs with errors or\nbiases, lacking cultural sensitivity, or where genai-written pieces missed the emotional depth\nor awareness of rhetorical context that human writers more naturally include.\n\n-  _Teaching Courses with GenAI:_ The application of GenAI tools in the teaching of courses that\n\nincorporate creative processes extends beyond mere content generation.\n\nIt offers an\nopportunity for personalized learning experiences, exposing students to a wide array of\nstyles and techniques.\n\nFor instance, in tasks that incorporate writing, GenAI tools can assist\nwith language development, genre awareness, and the structuring of arguments.\n\nIn tasks\nthat involve designing, it can suggest various aesthetic and functional design options, thus\nbroadening students' horizons.\n\nFaculty may consider integrating GenAI tools to facilitate\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch heightened awareness, designing their assignments in ways that ensure the focus\nremains on the development of students' critical and creative skills.\n\n-  _GenAI Tools and the Design of Process-Oriented Assignments:_ Designing assignments that\nrequire an iterative creative process that integrates GenAI demands particular care and\nconsideration.\n\nThis involves creating assignments that leverage GenAI as an educational\ntool while also fostering critical thinking and creativity in students.\n\nFor example, faculty\nmay design writing assignments where GenAI tools are leveraged only for initial idea\ngeneration and brainstorming.\n\nSuch assignments would then require students to select one\nconcept and develop and refine it further.\n\nOther assignments may ask students to reflect on\ntheir process of working with GenAI tools.\n\nThis could involve reflective writing about the\ndecisions they made after receiving GenAI outputs, how they incorporated GenAI\nsuggestions into their work, and their thoughts on the creative balance between GenAI and\nhuman input.\n\nConversely, certain assignments might intentionally limit the use of GenAI tools to highlight areas\nwhere human insight is paramount, such as understanding cultural nuances or ethical\nconsiderations in designing a poster.\n\nIn these instances, faculty may introduce assignments that\nrequire skills GenAI tools cannot replicate, such as hand-drawn sketches of local subjects or\nanalytical writing based on personal experiences, encouraging students to value and develop their\nuniquely human creative abilities.\n\n4.2.\n\nC ONCERNS ABOUT A DOPTING GenAI IN C REATIVE P ROCESSES\n\nAdopting GenAI tools in areas that require knowledge and experience of a creative process,\nincluding almost any kind of writing or design, raises several concerns:\n\n-  _Concerns in Society:_ Instructors who integrate GenAI tools in courses that incorporate\n\ncreativity must be supported to recognize broader societal concerns.\n\nIssues such as\npotential job displacement in creative fields and ethical implications need to be\nacknowledged and addressed in classrooms.\n\nThrough training and support for genai literacy,\nfaculty can be prepared to discuss these topics, incorporating them into the curriculum to\nfoster a holistic understanding of the impact of GenAI tools.\n\nFaculty can also become\nprepared to discuss copyright and intellectual property policies and regulations with\nstudents when integrating the use of GenAI.\n\n-  _Plagiarism:_ A primary concern about GenAI tools in academia, especially in courses that\n\nincorporate writing, is the blurred line between student-generated and GenAI content.\n\nPlagiarism takes a new form with GenAI, where the originality of ideas and expressions can\nbe challenging to ascertain (see the related discussion in Appendix C).", "Plagiarism takes a new form with GenAI, where the originality of ideas and expressions can\nbe challenging to ascertain (see the related discussion in Appendix C).\n\nFaculty may need to\nrevisit their assignment design, assessment strategies, and GenAI-use policies.\n\nThis might\ninvolve more emphasis on the process of creation, requiring students to submit drafts and\nreflections on their work.\n\nThe use of GenAI tools in any creative work produced should not\nviolate BU\u2019s Academic Conduct Code.\n\nFor example, using GenAI tools to paraphrase existing\nworks without citing them is still plagiarism (see [3] for similar concerns expressed by\nscientific publishers).\n\n-----\n\n-  _Misinformation:_ GenAI tools can sometimes generate plausible but factually incorrect\n\ninformation, posing a risk of misinformation.\n\n-  _Over-Reliance:_ An over-reliance on GenAI tools might impede the development of critical\n\nthinking and originality among students and may lead to poor-quality and factually\ninaccurate student artifacts.\n\nFaculty need to emphasize the importance of verifying\ninformation and encourage students to approach GenAI outputs with a critical eye.\n\nAssignments may need to be redesigned to require independent thought and verification of\nfacts and sources.\n\n-  _Ethical Issues:_ There is a concern that GenAI-driven artifacts might not adequately represent\n\nor respect the diversity of student populations.\n\nThrough training and support, faculty can be\nmade aware that GenAI tools used in the classroom are not free from biases and may not be\ninclusive.\n\nThis suggests approaching GenAI tools with a critical mind, and teaching students\nto recognize and critically assess any biases in GenAI outputs.\n\n4.3.\n\nU SE C ASES\n\nThe use of GenAI tools as a collaborative tool for writing and design processes adds significant\nvalue in a multitude of applications across various academic and societal contexts.\n\nThe following\nuse cases highlight the versatility and potential of GenAI tools in educational and practical contexts.\n\n-  _Academic Writing:_ GenAI is helpful in academic writing in a variety of ways, including\n\nincreasing productivity when it comes to the initial gathering of literature based on\npredefined criteria, therefore saving considerable time and effort.\n\nGenAI has the ability to\nassist in synthesizing key findings and themes from a vast array of sources and suggesting\npotential areas of inquiry.\n\n-  _Expanding Creative Boundaries in Arts:_ In the visual arts, GenAI tools have the potential to\n\nplay a pivotal role in personal artistic development and expression.\n\nBy inputting ideas and\nsketches into GenAI systems (while also being mindful of copyright laws and inputting any\npersonal creative work), artists can receive variations and evolutions of their initial\nconcepts rendered in multiple styles.\n\nThis not only accelerates the ideation process but also\nprovides artists with new perspectives on their own work.\n\n-  _Facilitating an Education that Incorporates Creativity:_ In tasks that incorporate creativity,\n\nGenAI tools can aid in tailoring learning materials to individual student needs and providing\nassistance.\n\nThis could include fostering a more process-oriented and personalized learning\nenvironment.\n\n-  _Using GenAI in Graphic Design:_ GenAI transforms the field of graphic design by providing\n\ntools that can assist in generating creative visuals, suggesting design layout options, and\noffering color scheme recommendations.\n\nIt can be used to create initial design concepts,\nwhich designers can then refine and personalize.\n\nThis not only accelerates the design\nprocess but also opens up new avenues for creativity and experimentation.\n\nGraphic design\nstudents can leverage GenAI tools to explore and learn about diverse styles and techniques\nand experiment with a plethora of options, thereby expanding their creative repertoire.\n\n-  _Streamlining Integrated Communication Campaigns:_ The utility of GenAI tools in creating\n\ncoherent and impactful messages is invaluable for communication campaigns.\n\nIts use allows\n\n\n-----\n\nfor a unified approach where a single individual can effectively manage both the narrative\nand visual aspects, ensuring messaging consistency and efficiency in a campaign.\n\n-  _Drafting Public-Facing Documents and Campaign Materials:_ For larger societal contributions,\n\nGenAI tools can assist in crafting public documents and materials that are designed to\ncommunicate complex ideas in an accessible manner.\n\nThis is particularly beneficial for\nawareness campaigns, where clarity and communication around challenging topics are\nessential.\n\nIn conclusion, GenAI has the potential to be a powerful and effective tool for creating artifacts and\nenhancing creativity when used appropriately and responsibly.\n\nGenAI\u2019s role in transforming how\ncourses (e.g., analytic and creative writing, graphic design, arts, etc.)\n\nthat focus on a creative\nprocess are taught and practiced will be very significant.", "GenAI\u2019s role in transforming how\ncourses (e.g., analytic and creative writing, graphic design, arts, etc.)\n\nthat focus on a creative\nprocess are taught and practiced will be very significant.\n\nAs a result, at the very least, the existence\nof GenAI tools should be acknowledged in course policies.\n\nIt is important that the emphasis in\ncourses that incorporate writing and design elements should be on the process rather than solely\nthe end product.\n\nThe necessity of maintaining ethical standards and human oversight will always\nremain, and GenAI should be framed as a collaboration tool and assistant.\n\n-----\n\n5.\n\nG EN genai IN T EACHING , L EARNING , AND S TUDENT P ROFESSIONAL D EVELOPMENT\n\nThe principles set forth in Section 1.1 should motivate faculty to rethink teaching, assignments, and\nlearning outcomes for the GenAI era.\n\n-  _Redesign Assignments_ .\n\nMany students may use GenAI whether it is allowed or prohibited, so\n\nwe recommend that faculty re-visit their assignments, assessments, and teaching strategies,\nwhich may need to be adapted to reflect the prevalence of GenAI tools.\n\n-  _Process Scaffolding_ .\n\nFor courses that incorporate writing, arts, and design, we recommend\n\nthat work is scaffolded, thereby focusing more on the process than on the end product (see\nSection 4, above).\n\nOne way to do this involves requiring students to submit iterative drafts\nand reflections on the evolution of their work in stages.\n\nAnother way involves requiring\nstudents to orally present and defend their work in class, in small groups, or in meetings\nwith instructors whenever class size makes such an approach feasible.\n\n-  _Avoiding Take-Home Exams_ .\n\nInstructors, when feasible, can increase their reliance on in-\n\nclass testing and in-person evaluations, while keeping in mind the possibility that such\nmodes of evaluation can pose accessibility problems for some students.\n\nMore detailed considerations follow.\n\n5.1.\n\nC OURSE P OLICIES\n\nSeveral high-level policies are relevant here.\n\n-  _Institutional Diversity:_ BU is a large, diverse institution, and no single, \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d\nGenAI course policy can comprehend the great diversity of learning outcomes, teaching\nmethods, disciplinary cultures, and assessment practices across BU\u2019s schools and colleges.\n\nAny single policy meant to apply to all courses across the University would have to be so\nvague that it would be of little practical use.\n\nThus, we recommend against a monolithic,\nUniversity-wide policy on GenAI use in the classroom.\n\n-  _University-Wide Policy:_ However, we do recommend that a University-wide policy be\nadopted requiring every course syllabus at BU to include specific guidance and boundaries\naround how GenAI tools may and may not be used to produce submitted work.\n\n-  _Explicit Guidance for Students:_ GenAI tools can be powerful learning adjuncts, so faculty are\n\nencouraged to explore how they could be leveraged rather than banned.\n\nHowever, GenAI\ntools can also be used as shortcuts that inhibit or distort learning.\n\nThe precise risks and\nopportunities differ for each course, and students need clear, explicit guidance to\nunderstand how GenAI tools should and should not be used in each context.\n\nIdeally, faculty\nwill clearly indicate if, when, and how GenAI tools can be used on class assignments.\n\nSample\nstatements can be found on the BU Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) website .\n\n-  _Academic Integrity:_ Syllabi should clearly state that use of GenAI tools outside the indicated\n\nscope is considered a violation of academic integrity.\n\n-  _Faculty Reasoning:_ To support genai literacy, faculty might provide students with information\n\nabout why they have chosen to allow or not allow its use on a particular assignment.\n\n-----\n\n-  _Faculty Transparency:_ Faculty need to specify how teaching staff may use GenAI tools in\n\nlearning activities and assignments for each course, so students understand the role of\nGenAI in faculty teaching.\n\n5.2.\n\nF ACULTY AND S TUDENT R ESPONSIBILITIES\n\nStudents and teachers incur a range of responsibilities in relation to the appropriate use of GenAI\ntools.\n\n-  _Universal genai Literacy_ .\n\nIn making a shift towards requiring that all syllabi include information\n\non GenAI tool use, all members of our community need to know some basic facts about\nGenAI tools.\n\n-  _Faculty Adaptation_ .\n\nFaculty need to recognize that many students are now entering the\n\nUniversity as experienced users of GenAI tools, already in the habit of using GenAI as a\nlearning tool, an assistant, and a collaborator.\n\nJust as the advent of the Internet in the 1990s\nand the smartphone in the 2000s forced faculty to reimagine their courses, change their\nteaching practices, and articulate clear policies for using the new technologies, so now\nfaculty need to be supported to craft adaptive responses to the era of GenAI tools.\n\n-  _Faculty Need to Continually Adapt_ .", "-  _Faculty Need to Continually Adapt_ .\n\nFaculty need to recognize that students today must be\n\nprepared for GenAI tool use in their future careers and become genai literate.\n\nBecause genai will\nimpact every field and discipline, students in every school and college need to understand\nthe basics of how GenAI works, where its strengths and weaknesses lie, and how to\nengineer effective prompts.\n\nThis is part of what is meant by the term genai literacy, but as the\ntechnology changes, as new tools become available, and as these tools become more deeply\nintegrated into the workplace, the meaning of genai literacy will also change.\n\n-  _Faculty Need to Stay Up to Date_ .\n\nThe current state of GenAI will evolve rapidly.\n\nFaculty in all\n\ndisciplines will need to stay informed about new developments, and BU offices such as CTL\nwill need to offer ongoing assistance.\n\n-  _Faculty Can Make Use of GenAI as Student Coaches_ .\n\nWe need to inform faculty that GenAI can\n\nprovide students with a deeper understanding of course content by giving them formative\nfeedback or clearer examples.\n\nFor example, BU students report that they are already using\nChatGPT to provide alternative definitions or explanations for key concepts.\n\nSome students\nalso report using ChatGPT to create practice questions to help them prepare for exams.\n\nFaculty need to know that students are using GenAI in this way, and they should consider\nhow they can capitalize on this to further students\u2019 mastery of course content.\n\n-  _Faculty Need to Understand Limitations of GenAI Detection_ .\n\nAll faculty need to understand\n\nthe limitations of GenAI-detection tools, which should be used with caution (see Appendix C\nfor further details).\n\nWith the risk of false positives in mind, genai-detection tools could be used\nas only one element in a larger body of evidence for assessing the originality of student\nwork.\n\nIn addition, faculty who choose to use detection tools should apply the tools\nconsistently to all students in their classes, not to a subset chosen on the basis of gut-level\nsuspicion or imperfect signals.\n\nFaculty should consider this in the information they provide\nto students about class assignments, and they should be transparent about their adopted\nGenAI detection and rule enforcement strategies.\n\n-----\n\n-  _Faculty, Not genai, Must Assign Grades_ .\n\nGenAI tools should not determine grading, supply\n\nfeedback, or stipulate learning outcomes in courses.\n\nSuch decisions \u2013 whether it is the grade\nbreakdown on a syllabus or a specific grade for a particular student\u2019s work \u2013 should be\nmade by faculty, not outsourced to GenAI tools.\n\nGenAI is not yet reliable or subtle enough to\nmanage such critical tasks without a \u201chuman in the loop.\u201d\n\n-  _Faculty Should Not Assume that Students are Experts_ .\n\nFaculty should not assume that\n\nstudents understand GenAI tools.\n\nStudents may have used GenAI tools, perhaps extensively.\n\nBut faculty should not assume that all students understand how GenAI works or what it can\nand cannot do.\n\nIn conversations with several student panels, the varying interest and\nexpertise among our current students was clear.\n\n-  _Faculty Need to Teach Students about Limitations and Nuances_ .\n\nTo use GenAI tools ethically\n\nand productively, students need to understand that their outputs are probabilistic\npredictions (informed guesses); that training datasets reflect a number of known biases;\nand that even when outputs incorporate web searching, GenAI tools can still hallucinate\nwhile appearing confident and authoritative.\n\nAt this point in their development, GenAI tools\ntend to generate writing that qualitatively tends toward the mean and is primarily\ndeclarative rather than critical or analogical.\n\nBoth faculty and students need to take\nresponsibility for their own work.\n\nAll GenAI output needs to be revised, edited, and\nvalidated.\n\n-  _Preparing for Changing Careers_ .\n\nBoth faculty and students need to be aware that GenAI will\n\ncontinue to transform the way that professionals in most industries work.\n\nBU must prepare\nstudents for this new method of working.\n\nSoon, GenAI will be incorporated in nearly every\nsoftware product.\n\ngenai will affect every discipline and it is becoming an important skill sought\nby employers.\n\nThe BU Center for Career Development offers a set of resources to students\nas they look to start their professional careers, and it would be helpful to consider adding\nworkshops related to genai.\n\nThe Hariri Institute is running a student-led Data Science\nMentoring Circles Program , offering BU alumni now in industry as mentors to graduate\nstudents seeking careers in data science.\n\n-  _Faculty Must Not Ignore GenAI Tools_ .\n\nFinally, faculty are advised to not avoid discussing\n\nGenAI.\n\nGenAI is now a presence in our lives and our students\u2019 lives, one that is changing the\nway we research, write, and learn.\n\nWe believe that ignoring it and refusing to address its\nimplications is no longer an option.", "We believe that ignoring it and refusing to address its\nimplications is no longer an option.\n\nFaculty need university support to become prepared for\ndiscussions with students about GenAI, its role in student learning, its possible uses (ethical\nand unethical), and its limitations.\n\n5.3.\n\nA DMINISTRATION R ESPONSIBILITIES\n\nUniversity administrators also incur responsibilities due to GenAI Tools.\n\n-  _Professional Development:_ BU needs to support ongoing professional development,\n\nincluding providing grants and resources to allow faculty to experiment and innovate with\nGenAI.\n\nBoth the risks and the potential benefits of GenAI tools for research, teaching, and\nstudent learning are considerable, but largely unexplored and untested.\n\nFaculty may need to\nreimagine and revise many of their existing teaching methods, course designs, syllabi,\n\n\n-----\n\nassignments, and classroom activities to capitalize on this technology and stay abreast of\nnew developments.\n\nInvestments may also be needed to provide workshops, trainings,\nonline resources, and consultations for faculty engaging in this work.\n\nThis may require a\nconsiderable investment of time for which faculty and staff may deserve compensation,\ndepending on the nature of the investment.\n\nIn addition, some funding should perhaps be\nmade available for more structured studies, designed to develop and promulgate new\napproaches to teaching and learning.\n\n-  _Centralized Resources:_ A continuously maintained set of GenAI resources for faculty and\nstudents is imperative.\n\nFaculty need access to sample syllabi, course policies, advisory\nstatements, use examples, and instructions.\n\nCTL , DL&I , and other offices can provide those\nresources.\n\nOpportunities should be available for faculty to discuss GenAI resources with\nCTL and DL&I staff and other experts.\n\n-  _Managing Inequities:_ Teaching with GenAI tools should not lead to inequities among\nstudents.\n\nWhile we encourage faculty to develop new ways of using GenAI as an effective\nlearning tool, we are also aware that some tools have paid tiers that may be difficult for\nsome students to afford.\n\nFinancial inequity should not imply unequal opportunity to learn\nor complete work efficiently.\n\nThis concern may possibly be alleviated as prices change, or\ncompletely resolved through University-negotiated site licenses.\n\nThe integration of GenAI tools in education presents both challenges and opportunities.\n\nBy\nunderstanding the capabilities and limitations of GenAI tools, incorporating thoughtful policies into\nsyllabi, and fostering an environment of continuous learning and adaptation, educational\ninstitutions can effectively harness the potential of GenAI tools.\n\nThis approach will not only\nenhance the learning experience but also prepare students and faculty for a future where GenAI\ntools are an integral part of the professional and academic landscape.\n\n-----\n\nA PPENDICES\n\nA PPENDIX A: T RANSFORMERS AND THE GPT M ODELS\n\nGenAI models are based on deep learning approaches using neural networks, which are formed by\narranging stacked layers of computational \u201cneurons.\u201d These neural networks perform basic linear\nand nonlinear transformations on a vector input to produce some other scalar or vector output.\n\nAmong the first generative models were so called _Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)_ [52] that\nwere designed to generate images to be presented to an image classifier in an effort to improve the\nclassifier.\n\nLater applications focused on _Natural Language Processing_ (NLP), giving rise to _Large_\n_Language Models_ (LLMs).\n\nA breakthrough in the field is considered to be the introduction of the transformer architecture\n\n[53], which provided a way for identifying which words in a sentence the model should pay\nattention to provide the proper context while mapping a word into a numerical vector (called\nembedding).\n\nThis architecture was first used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) purposes in\nthe _Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers_ (BERT) model [54], which is able to\nencode each word (or smaller pieces called tokens) in its input text, taking into account an entire\npassage of text.\n\nThe so called _Generative Pre-Trained Transformer_ (GPT) architecture [55] also uses transformers\nbut only uses past words in a sentence to predict the next word, and thus functions as a sentence\ncompletion algorithm that can be made recursive.\n\nSubsequent GPT models became larger (GPT-2\n\n[56], GPT-3 [57]) and were shown to exhibit emergent properties (\u201cfew-shot\u201d learning with no\ndomain adaptation [57]).\n\nThe latest version, GPT-4 [7], powers Open genai\u2019s ChatGPT and has been\ntrained on vast amounts of data (on the order of 45 GB), consisting of a collection of models with\nover 1.7 trillion parameters.\n\nIn addition to the ability of GPTs to predict the next word and their sheer size, another important\nelement of their success is training with human feedback [37], [38].", "In addition to the ability of GPTs to predict the next word and their sheer size, another important\nelement of their success is training with human feedback [37], [38].\n\nThis involves humans rating\nthe output of the model and ranking several model outputs for appropriateness.\n\nIn both cases, the\nhuman ratings are used to further improve the model and moderate its output.\n\nA transformer model can also be adapted to generate images from text.\n\nAt a high level, the model is\ntrained on a vast collection of images with accompanying text descriptions.\n\nThis kind of model\npowers OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E image-generation model [8].\n\nMany of the same principles can be applied\nto other forms of input and output, including audio and video.\n\nA PPENDIX B: S URVEY OF D EANS ON GenAI IN R ESEARCH\n\nAssociate Deans for Research Responding to the

time\n\nA PPENDIX C: A S TUDY OF GenAI T EXT D ETECTORS\n\nA number of genai-detection tools have been released since GPT-2 became available in 2019 [56].\n\nUnfortunately, none of them can reliably and consistently detect genai outputs [58], [59].\n\nThe\nfundamental problem is that GenAI outputs are usually unique and carry no \u201cwatermark\u201d or\nsignature that would confirm that they were produced by a machine.", "The\nfundamental problem is that GenAI outputs are usually unique and carry no \u201cwatermark\u201d or\nsignature that would confirm that they were produced by a machine.\n\nAlthough some of the tools\nboast high accuracy rates, independent studies indicate that all these tools are fallible, especially if\nthe output has been modified by humans.\n\nEven a small chance of a false positive \u2013 that is, a result\nthat falsely claims the writing was produced by GenAI \u2013 means that students could be unjustly\naccused of academic misconduct.\n\nThis is not an acceptable risk.\n\nThe genai task force arranged for a systematic analysis of the reliability (accuracy and consistency) of\nGenAI detectors.\n\nThis analysis was produced in association with the spring 2024 edition of the CDS\nDS380 \u201cData, Society, and Ethics\u201d course (for authors and acknowledgements, see Appendix F).\n\nThis\nanalysis is a useful practical guide for professors as they consider how to detect GenAI material in\nstudent submissions.\n\nThere are two reliability issues at stake in the small landscape of GenAI detectors.\n\nOn the one hand,\nwhile text detectors are generally well over 90% _accurate_ , the probabilistic nature of detector\njudgments allows for the possibility that they can be badly mistaken, in both directions, producing\nfalse negatives (they mistakenly find human-generated text) and false positives (they mistakenly\nfind GenAI text).\n\nThe latter can be devastating for a student who did nothing improper.\n\nOn the other\nhand, students may want to run a GenAI detector on an assignment to see what their grader will\nsee, thereby protecting themselves from disciplinary charges based on a false positive detector\n\n\n-----\n\nreading.\n\nThis calls for reliability in the sense of consistency, but GenAI text have been reported as\nsupplying quite different probability estimates on the very same document at different times.\n\nSome GenAI policies, such as the genai Assistance Policy from the Faculty of Computing &\nData Sciences, encourage students to employ GenAI detectors to protect themselves against false\naccusations that might lead to disciplinary action.\n\nBut such recommendations are only fully feasible\nif GenAI detectors give consistent readings.\n\nThe experiment involved seven GenAI text detectors, seven varieties of texts with various\ncombinations of human-creation and GenAI creation to evaluate accuracy, and three time points\none day and one week apart to evaluate consistency.\n\nThe seven texts used in this experiment had the following origins and characteristics:\n\n-  genai-made with ChatGPT 4;\n\n-  genai-made with Gemini (formerly Bard);\n\n-  Made by a native English-speaking human;\n\n-  Made by a non-native English-speaking human;\n\n-  genai-made (ChatGPT 4) with intentional misspellings;\n\n-  genai-made (Gemini) with intentional grammar errors;\n\n-  genai-made (ChatGPT 4) with human-made sentences interposed.\n\nThe seven genai Detectors were those that did not require paying a fee and delivered either a numeric\nprobability estimate or a boolean guess (human or genai):\n\n-  Copyleaks (  ) \u2013 detects GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT,\n\nGPT-4, T5, Bert, and Jasper.\n\n-  Originality (  ) \u2013 detects GPT-3, 3.5, and ChatGPT.\n\n-  Crossplag (  ).\n\n-  Sapling (  ) \u2013 detects ChatGPT and Gemini; developed\n\nby former researchers at University of California Berkeley, Stanford University, Google, and\nMeta; free version allows up to 2,000 characters.\n\n-  Winston genai (  ) \u2013 detects GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4; free version\n\nallows up to 2,000 words.\n\n-  Content At Scale (  ) \u2013 detects GPT-2, GPT-3, 3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-\n\n4.\n\n-  GPTZero (  ) \u2013 to be carefully distinguished from ZeroGPT, which seems\n\ndesigned to benefit from GPTZero\u2019s fame, and which we found to be unreliable.\n\nThe experimental design involved the following steps:\n\n-  Apply each genai detector to the test text and record detection results.\n\n-  Repeat the testing procedure three times for each detector (Day 1: Feb 1, 2024, Day 2: Feb\n2, 2024, Day 7: Feb 8, 2024) and use a different computer and a different IP address for Day\n7.\n\n-  Evaluate detectors' ability to consistently classify native, ESL, genai-generated, and modified\ntexts.\n\nEvaluation involved assessing:\n\n\n-----\n\n-  consistency of ratings;\n\n-  success rate of genai detectors in identifying human modifications aimed at deceiving them;\n\n-  appearance of paywalls that limit access.", "Results (percentages are probability that text is genai-generated, orange shading means bad detector\nguess, P means a paywall was encountered and testing did not continue):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Col1|Col2|genai-made (ChatGPT4)|genai-made (Gemini)|Human (native English)|Human (non- native

and GPTZero were the most accurate and also largely\nconsistent on this limited test, with Copyleaks handling intentional grammar errors better.\n\nThus,\nfor the purposes of consistent ratings for both students and graders, on the basis of this limited\nevaluation, Copyleaks is the best option followed by GPTZero.\n\nThe others are too inaccurate or too\ninconsistent to use

GenAI policy and advice documents from institutions of higher education.\n\nThis app also\nincludes semantic network analysis and topic modeling for those documents.\n\nThis app was\nproduced by the members and TAs of the Fall 2023 edition of the CDS DS380 \u201cData, Society, and\nEthics\u201d course, with the help of two undergraduate designers and developers.\n\nDuring the spring 2024 semester, a machine-learning student group from SPARK!\n\nenhanced this\nsite in several ways.\n\nThey expanded the dataset to include policy and advice documents from K-12\neducation, government, and business domains, as well as higher education.\n\nThey built a topic model\nand a semantic network analysis based on themes instead of documents.\n\nIn addition, they used\nGenAI to automate document tagging and they upgraded the interface.\n\nA PPENDIX E: E XAMPLES OF GenAI U SE AND FOR R ESEARCH AND E DUCATION\n\nWe provide examples of GenAI use for research and education purposes.\n\nThe examples referring to\nclass activities and assignments have been developed by faculty in the CAS Writing Program and the\nRhetoric Department at CGS.\n\n-  _Fine-tuning LLMs for specific uses._ As mentioned in Section 3.2, LLMs can be used to analyze\nand extract useful information from a variety of documents, which can then be used to train\nvarious models.\n\nGeneric LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, have been trained on large\ntext corpora but may lack an ability to process specialized text.\n\nOne prominent example is\nclinical text, which is rich in specialized medical terms and abbreviations.\n\nMotivated by\napplications in healthcare, researchers have been able to use available datasets of clinical\nreports (often the MIMIC dataset, consisting of ICU clinical reports and discharge notes [60],\n\n[61]) to fine-tune generic LLMs for analyzing and extracting information from clinical notes.\n\nOne such effort is based on the open-source Llama LLM [62].\n\n-  _Using LLMs to streamline literature review._ Section 3.2 mentions using LLMs to automate\nliterature review.\n\nAsking an LLM to write a literature review for a specific project is not the\nbest way to leverage its abilities and, because of the hallucinations we have discussed, it\nmay produce plausible but false references.\n\nAs an example, two lawyers have been\nsanctioned for submitting a legal brief that included six fictitious case citations generated by\nChatGPT [63].\n\nIn work soon to be published, a group of researchers at the Hariri Institute\ndeveloped an approach where an LLM is fed with abstracts of published papers (extracted\nusing a set of keywords from a public database such as PubMed).\n\nThe LLM is then asked\nwhether a given abstract indicates that the paper contains a result that the researchers care\nabout.\n\nThrough elaborate prompt engineering, it becomes possible to obtain accurate\nYES/NO responses from the LLM.", "Through elaborate prompt engineering, it becomes possible to obtain accurate\nYES/NO responses from the LLM.\n\nSuch an approach can be used to narrow down a potential\nlarge number of papers one may recover through keyword search to a more manageable list\nthat a human group can then study.\n\n-  _Brainstorming counterarguments_ **.\n\n** Instructors may ask students to use a genai\n(GenAI) platform to list potential objections to or limitations of a claim they are making in\ntheir papers or projects.\n\nIn such an activity, students consider and evaluate the objections\n\n\n-----\n\ncreated by GenAI, and choose at least one objection to acknowledge and respond to in their\npaper.\n\nIf using GenAI-generated objections, students should be asked to: (1) acknowledge\nthe use of GenAI in their paper (e.g., list in the Works Cited or acknowledge GenAI usage in a\nletter to the reader), and (2) express the objection in their own words, rather than copy the\nGenAI-produced text.\n\n_Practicing debate with genai platforms_ **_._** One can use GenAI platforms to help\nstudents prepare for a class debate.\n\nMany GenAI platforms now have a voice feature (e.g.,\nChatGPT-4 mobile app) where an instructor can have their students engage in a real-time\nvoice conversation with the platform.\n\nStudents choose a position (affirmation or negation of\na resolution), and interact with the GenAI platform.\n\nSuch an activity develops critical\nthinking and argumentation skills; helps students practice articulating and defending a\nposition on a specific topic and encourages students to critically analyze genai's responses\nand generate thoughtful counterarguments in return.\n\n_Using GenAI as a peer reviewer to solicit feedback_ **.\n\n** One can ask students to interact with\nGenAI as a peer reviewer.\n\nFirst, have students solicit feedback on their paper draft or an\nexcerpt from their draft, listing two or three criteria they want GenAI to use in evaluating\ntheir draft.\n\nThese criteria should be directly connected to the student assignment.\n\nNext,\nencourage students to critically evaluate the feedback they received from genai and to\ndecide whether or not they agree with it and how they might respond to it.\n\n_Understanding an author\u2019s frame of reference_ **.\n\n** Many writers have a particular frame of\nreference: for example, early essayists like Michel de Montaigne and Francis Bacon\nfrequently quote Roman authors, Virginia Woolf often references 19th and 20th century\nliterature, and so on.\n\nUsing genai, students can get some quick information about a group\nof referenced authors or works, and also learn what those authors and works have in\ncommon, giving them a stronger sense of an author\u2019s frame of reference.\n\n_Getting out of the weeds_ **.\n\n** When a course presents students with multiple perspectives on a\ntopic or issue, they might get confused or overwhelmed.\n\nAt such a point, it can help to ask\nthem to identify their questions (perhaps by freewriting for a few minutes), then pose their\nquestions to GenAI.\n\nSharing their questions and the GenAI\u2019s answers in discussion can help\nstudents dispel confusion and feel better prepared to move forward.\n\n_Comparing human response to machine analysis to better understand_ **_pathos._** genai can do a\nsurprisingly good job of analyzing the emotional appeal of essays and stories, and even of\nparticular passages if one uploads the text.\n\nStudents can learn about the nuances of\nemotional appeal by comparing GenAI\u2019s analysis to their own.\n\nOften, GenAI gives an\narticulate analysis, and yet misses subtleties.\n\n-----\n\nR EFERENCES\n\n[1] \u201cPublishing ethics | Elsevier policy,\u201d .\n\nAccessed: Jan. 10, 2024.\n\n[Online].\n\nAvailable:

This is advice that Katie Conrad, professor of English, provided to colleagues in her department.\n\nIt includes a syllabus statement for an honors class she is teaching.\n\nNo matter your position on the use of so-called genai in the classroom, I recommend that you consider first your\ncourse goals and whether and how any given technology might undermine or support your students in the\nprocess of meeting those goals.\n\nIn full disclosure, I take a \u201ccritical genai literacy\u201d (Bali 2023) approach to the\nmedia-generative tools now commonly called \u201cgenai\u201d: that is, we need to understand these tools in\norder to know when and when not to use them, and we need to consider them in the larger context out of which\nthey emerge, including the harms associated with them.\n\nMy approach below is informed by my \u201c Blueprint for an\ngenai Bill of Rights for Education \u201d.\n\nJust as a reminder, Sean Kamperman and I put together some curated resources\non the topic of critical genai literacy for our genai & Digital Literacy Summit in June, including a number of tools (NB:\nassume no particular judgment on our part on the inclusion or exclusion of any given tool).\n\nFor your reference and to give you a sense of a range of possible individual classroom policy responses to\ngenai (the cluster of tools including ChatGPT and other LLMs like Bing, Bard, and Claude), Lance Eaton\nhas curated a collection of \u201c Classroom Policies for genai Generative Tools .\u201d (Note that many of these were crafted in\n\nearly spring 2023 before the launch of other models and before the incorporation of genai options into\nGoogle Docs and Grammarly [known as GrammarlyGo, and currently only available with the paid model]).\n\nBelow is a short draft syllabus policy that you are welcome to adapt and/or adopt; it is not meant to be\nprescriptive.\n\nThere may well be uses for genai tools in your course, and if you can imagine ways that students might\nproductively use them, I recommend being very clear about where and why students might be allowed to use\nthem and how you want students to cite their usage.\n\n(Note: there is not yet an agreed-upon standard for citing\nlarge language models; the APA has suggested a model , but it has been criticized for treating LLMs as equivalent\nto authors\u2014problematic for a number of reasons including that they synthesize the work of human authors\nwithout citation and that their outputs are not repeatable.)\n\nI have also included the draft of my longer policy for the class in which I will be teaching about genai; this\nincludes language about citing use (and distinguishes between researching and analyzing genai and\nusing it to complete writing assignments).\n\nIf any of it is useful for you, feel free to use it.\n\nI am also happy to\ndiscuss anyone else\u2019s draft policies if you would find that useful.", "### Sample genai policy\n\nAcademic integrity is essential for a fair evaluation of your work and that of your classmates, as KU\u2019s policies on\nacademic misconduct make clear.\n\nAll work submitted in this course must be your own.\n\nAssignments for this course are designed to help you develop your critical thinking, close reading, research, and\nwriting skills.\n\nSubmitting other people\u2019s work as your own, repurposing work you have done for other courses\nwithout my prior approval and without substantial revision, or using so-called genai tools for your work in this course\nundermines those goals.\n\nIn this course, you may not use ChatGPT or other genai software for your\nassignments, including plug-ins or native tools that automatically generate text within word-processing apps.\n\nExceptions include the grammar check and spellcheck options on your word-processing software or Grammarly\ngrammar check (but not GrammarlyGO\u2019s generative text option); these approved tools make suggestions for\nrevising work that you have already generated and may be used with caution and with the understanding that\n\nyou are, as always, ultimately responsible for the work you generate.\n\nIf you have questions about what constitutes\nacademic misconduct (plagiarism or unauthorized use of tools or assistance), please ask me before submitting\nyour work.\n\n-----\n\nThis course is about so-called genai and aims to build literacy in concepts related to those tools,\nincluding understanding the ethical and social implications of this technology and what might be appropriate\nuses for it.\n\nIt is likely that you will choose to research and analyze genai outputs as part of your final\nproject; if you do so, as part of that assignment, you will disclose which tools you have used and explain how you\nhave used them.\n\nYou should keep a complete, accurate record of your prompts and the model's responses; the\nname and, where available, version numbers of the model (e.g., Chat GPT 4, Midjourney 5.2, NightCafe SDXL 0.9,\nBing Chat Creative Mode); and the dates of your interactions (which will, among other things, help us\nreconstruct versions for those models that don't provide them, like Bing; but will also provide a more nuanced\nsense of models that are fine-tuned between version releases).\n\nKeeping detailed records is good practice for any\ncourse in which the use of genai is approved for any portion of an assignment.\n\nAnalyzing genai tools and their outputs as part of an assignment is not the same as using them to\ncomplete your assignments.\n\nAt this stage in your educational career, I aim to help you develop your critical\nthinking and research skills, no matter what your chosen disciplines/field(s) of study might be.\n\nI am also\ninterested in helping you develop your ability to communicate your thoughts and opinions.\n\nFor these learning\ngoals in this course, using (rather than analyzing) genai in your assignments will not help you gain the\ncompetencies you need, and indeed are likely to undermine them.\n\nWith this in mind, for writing assignments for\nthis course, you are allowed to use built-in spellcheck, grammar check, or Grammarly (without the genai\nfeature) after you have already brainstormed and drafted your work.\n\nYou should not, however, use any separate,\nbuilt-in, or plug-in tool or feature that generates text (for example, Wordtune, Google Docs \"Help me write,\"\nGrammarlyGO generative text, ChatGPT, Claude, Bing, Bard) during the idea-generation or drafting stage of the\nwriting process.\n\nUltimately, remember that you are responsible for the writing and work you share, no matter\nwhat course you are in or platform you use to communicate, so even if you are using approved tools, check your\nwork before submitting it.\n\nUnauthorized use of genai tools in generating work for this course and attempting to pass it off as your own work\nconstitutes plagiarism; but plagiarism is a broader issue and is not dependent upon genai.\n\nSome specific examples\nof actions that constitute plagiarism include pasting together uncredited information or ideas from the internet\nor published sources; copying the wording of another source without quotation marks--even a few words--to\nindicate that the language is not your own (even if the source itself is cited); submitting an assignment written by\nsomeone else; submitting a paper written for another class without my approval and without substantial revision;\nand copying another student\u2019s work (even with the student\u2019s permission).\n\nIn order to avoid unintentional\nplagiarism and to represent your work honestly, you will need to be meticulous about giving credit to any and all\nsources, whether directly quoted or paraphrased.\n\nThis website uses cookies and other technologies to improve the functionality and performance of this site and your experience.Learn more\nby reviewing our Privacy Policy.\n\nPlagiarism hurts you as much as it does anyone.", "Plagiarism hurts you as much as it does anyone.\n\nIf you plagiarize work, you will not be receiving the practice and\nneeded feedback to improve your own critical thinking, research, and communication skills.\n\nPlagiarism will\ngenerally result in a 0 for the assignment in which the plagiarism was found; I will notify you and make clear my\nconcerns, and you are always welcome to discuss them with me.\n\nAll confirmed incidents of plagiarism will be OK\npenalized, reported, and kept on file in the English Department, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the\nUniversity Provost\u2019s Office, which means that the consequences of a second offense are higher.\n\nIf you have\nquestions, please ask me before submitting your assignment.\n\nAsking questions in advance of submission\nabout plagiarism or academic misconduct will not be held against you in any way.", "**Sample Syllabus Statements for the Use of genai Tools in Your Course**\nThe following guidance is provided to assist you in developing coherent policies on the use of generative\ngenai tools in your course.\n\nPlease adjust the guidance to fit your particular context.\n\nRemember also to note\nin specific assignment descriptions where genai use is allowed or disallowed.", "**Acceptable and Unacceptable Use of genai**\n\n_[This syllabus statement is useful when you are allowing the

instructors are already integrating genai into their teaching.\n\nOthers would prefer that students not use genai to complete\n\nassignments.\n\nBecause genai tools are constantly evolving, it is very difficult to develop technology that can reliably identify\nwhen a student uses genai to complete an assignment.\n\nThus, a policing approach to student use of genai has the potential to be\n\nboth time-consuming and unsuccessful.\n\nInstead, it is important to help students understand the issues associated with genai\nand its relationship to learning in general and your class in particular.\n\nThe following strategies can help instructors think about how to communicate with students, set expectations, and design\nassignments that increase students\u2019 motivation to develop their own skills and ideas.\n\nSet expectations \u2013 Establish a policy for your course around the use of genai-based tools (e.g., ChatGPT) and\ncommunicate this with students through the syllabus and/or assignment prompts.\n\nDiscuss how you will proceed if you\n\ndiscover that a student has turned in genai-generated work.\n\nHere are some sample syllabus statements you can use or\nadapt to help articulate your expectations for student use of genai in your course.\n\nCommunicate the importance of college learning \u2013 Many students are focused only on learning that seems related\nto their intended career track.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of them will change careers at least once in their lives.\n\nTalk\n\nwith students about how the relevance of your course may only become apparent years from now.\n\nThe skills they are\nlearning will likely transfer to other careers \u2013 even careers that do not yet exist!\n\nAcknowledge that struggle is part of learning \u2013 Talk with students about how intellectual struggle is an inherent part\nof learning.\n\nLearning happens only when we move outside what we already know.\n\nSeeking a shortcut or workaround\n\nthrough genai tools only prevents them from learning.\n\nThe short-term consequence is that they pay for a benefit they\nnever receive.\n\nThe long-term consequence is that they miss the opportunity to become better, more effective thinkers,\n\nwriters, researchers, and creators.\n\nDiscuss the social, ethical, and practical issues surrounding genai \u2013 The processes that support the development and\n\nfunctionality of genai-based tools raise issues related to privacy, disinformation, environmental impact, bias, exploitation,\nand academic integrity, among other things.\n\nIn addition, although genai-generated output appears authoritative and\n\nfactual, it is frequently riddled with inaccuracy.\n\nDiscussing the ethical and social concerns related to genai with students\ncan help them see the social context of genai and can position them to make thoughtful decisions about their own use of\n\ngenai-based tools.\n\nAssess process as much as (or more than) product \u2013 Lowering the stakes of individual assignments reduces students\u2019\n\nmotivation for cheating and encourages them to build their own skills and competencies.\n\nLow- or no-stakes formative\nassessments reinforce the notion that learning is a process and demonstrates to students that what\u2019s valuable is the\n\nlearning, not the grade.\n\n-----\n\nharder for genai-based tools to effectively connect the dots between these sources of knowledge.\n\nConsider teaching through genai-based tools.\n\nThink about how using genai-based tools might facilitate students\u2019 learning\n\nand prepare them to thoughtfully engage these tools in their personal and professional lives.\n\nHow can students use AIgenerated output to think critically and analytically?\n\nHow can these tools help them ask questions about digital literacy\n\nand information accuracy?\n\nFurther down this page we\u2019ve provided some examples of how to integrate genai into\nassignments.", "#### Using genai to enrich

facilitate learning.\n\nMany of these examples familiarize\n\nstudents with genai-based tools, but also prompt critical examination of their value, accuracy, strengths, and shortcomings.\n\nThink-pair-genai-share.\n\nStudents think (as individuals) about a question/concept, then pair up with a peer to discuss.\n\nThe\n\npair then plugs the question/concept into an genai

essay, lab\nreport, pr\u00e9cis, technical manual, blog post, etc.\n\nStudents prompt an genai tool to generate three versions of the\n\nassignment on a given topic and then use the rubric to evaluate the quality of the genai-generated versions.\n\n(2)\n\nImproving upon/adapting genai-generated output.\n\nStudents use an genai tool to draft text or code in response to a\n\nprompt.\n\nStudents must then improve upon the genai-generated output.\n\nWhen students turn in their assignment, they must\ninclude both the genai-generated text and their improved version.\n\n(3)\n\nExplaining the steps in an genai-generated solution.\n\nStudents use genai to solve a math problem.\n\nWorking from the AIgenerated solution, they then work in groups to explain or analyze the steps that the genai tool used to arrive at the\n\nsolution.\n\n(4)\n\nVisualizing concepts with genai.\n\nStudents select a concept covered in lecture or course readings.\n\nStudents then prompt\n\nan Al image generator to create an image that represents the connection between the concept and daily life.\n\nThey must\nthen explain how the Al-generated image conveys the concept and its relationship to daily life.\n\nStudents might also\n\nanalyze the strengths and shortcomings of genai image generators.\n\n(5)\n\nExploring genai in your field.\n\nStudents explore current applications of genai in the discipline of the

previously disseminated a briefing paper that delves into the risks\nand prospects associated with ChatGPT.\n\nBuilding upon the foundation laid by the briefing\npaper, this Policy Brief explores nascent methodologies applicable to the regulation of\ngenai systems.\n\ngenai systems are models that _generate_ new output\u2014whether\ntext, audio, or visual material\u2014based on data they have been trained on.\n\nChatGPT is one\nexample of a genai system.\n\nOther examples include Alibaba\u2019s \u2018Tongyi Qianwen\u2019,\nGoogle\u2019s \u2018Bard\u2019, and Microsoft\u2019s \u2018Vall-E\u2019.", "**China**\n\nChina is a central figure in the development of genai, and is expected to play a leading role in\nshaping the contours of the \u2018Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019.\n\nChina has adopted a top-down\napproach to genai regulation, characterized by strong government intervention and control.\n\nThe\nChinese government has issued comprehensive national strategies and plans for genai\ndevelopment, outlining specific goals, targets, and policy frameworks.\n\nIn contrast, Western\ncountries generally follow a more decentralised approach featuring a combination of\ngovernment regulations, industry self-regulation, and collaborative initiatives.\n\nOn a brief\ncomparative analysis, the regulatory developments emerging from China place a greater\nemphasis on social responsibility and group and community relations, with relatively less focus\non individualistic rights.\n\nThe regulatory framework includes the \u2018Measures for the\nManagement of genai Services (Draft for Comment)\u2019 (\u2018 _Draft_\n_Measures for genai Services_ \u2019); _Provisions on the Administration of Deep Synthesis of_\n_Internet Information Services_ (entered into force on 10 January 2023); and the _Personal_\n_Information Protection Law_ (entered into force on 1 November 2021).\n\nAn official translation\nof the _Draft Measures for genai Services_ is not available at the time of writing.\n\nTherefore, this Policy Brief relies on Stanford University\u2019s April 2023 translation .\n\nCrucially, a\nholistic analysis of China\u2019s high-level regulatory developments requires policymakers to assess\nthe structural, cultural, and political context that shapes its approach to and development of\ngenai.\n\nAs is the case with all jurisdictions, a nuanced understanding of the domestic and\ninternational interests is paramount for policymakers.", "**The European Union**\n\nThe EU\u2019s regulatory framework includes the General Data Protection Regulation ( _\u2018GDPR_ \u2019) and\nthe proposed \u2018genai Act \u2019 (\u2018 _Draft EU genai Act_ \u2019).\n\nUnder the 16 May 2023 compromise amendments to\nthe _Draft EU genai Act_ , genai systems will be considered \u2018foundation models\u2019, as they are\n\u2018designed to optimize for generality and versatility of output\u2019 and \u2018trained on a broad range of\ndata sources and large amounts of data\u2019 (para 60(e)).\n\nThe explanatory paragraph (60g) states\nthat this is intended to subject genai systems to specific requirements that distinguish\nsuch systems from \u2018high-risk\u2019 genai systems.\n\nAccordingly, article 28b requires providers of\nfoundation models to ensure their systems comply with EU regulations prior to becoming\navailable on the market by documenting risk assessment and mitigation; incorporating\nappropriate data sources and examining for biases.\n\nThe _Draft EU genai Act_ has also received\ncriticism from the genai ecosystem on the argument that it imposes excessive regulatory burdens\nand stifles innovation, contributing to Europe\u2019s further disadvantage in genai.\n\nThe _Draft genai Act_ is\nstill undergoing review and revision, and it is expected that the final version will address some\nof the concerns raised during the consultation process.\n\n-----", "**The United States**\n\nThe US does not have comprehensive federal regulations specifically focused on genai.\n\nHowever,\nvarious initiatives and efforts are underway to address genai-related concerns.\n\nThis mainly\nconsists of Agency Guidance: federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (\u2018FTC\u2019),\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology (\u2018NIST\u2019), and the Food and Drug\nAdministration (\u2018FDA\u2019) have all issued guidance and recommendations related to genai.\n\nFor\ninstance, the FTC provides guidelines on consumer protection and privacy concerns associated\nwith genai technologies, while NIST offers technical standards and best practices to promote\ntrustworthy genai development and deployment and has proposed the genai Risk Management\nFramework , which is intended to be voluntary.\n\nSupplementing the Agency Guidance is the\nBlueprint for an genai Bill of Rights (2022) (the \u2018Blueprint\u2019).\n\nThe Blueprint\u2014which is not binding\u2014\nis intended to support the development of policies and practices to protect the civil rights and\npromote democratic values in the building, deployment, and governance of automated\nsystems.\n\nUS regulation is lagging relative to China and the EU, with no actual or proposed binding federal\nlegislation to date.\n\nThere have been ongoing discussions and legislative proposals in the U.S.\nCongress regarding genai regulation.\n\nThese efforts seek to establish federal laws that address a\nwide range of genai-related issues, including privacy, bias, transparency, and accountability.\n\nSeveral bills have been introduced, but as of now, no comprehensive federal genai legislation has\nbeen enacted.\n\nWhile this absence of federal legislation may be thought to encourage\ninnovation, an alternative possibility is that clarifying the regulatory framework\u2014or lack\nthereof\u2014can increase investment in genai due to greater legal certainty.", "#### Regulating Risks Posed by genai Systems\n\nOf paramount importance is the proper categorisation of the risks posed by genai\nsystems, distinguishing between the short-term and long-term risks.\n\nThis Policy Brief focuses\non the short-term risks outlined in the Briefing Paper , which are (i) impersonation and\ndisinformation; (ii) privacy and security; (iii) bias and discrimination; and (iv) intellectual\nproperty infringement.\n\nThe regulatory strategies used, or proposed, to mitigate these risks are\ndiscussed in turn.", "**1   Impersonation and Disinformation**\n\ngenai systems have the capacity to mimic individuals, resulting in the proliferation of\nadvanced disinformation and fraudulent activities.\n\nThis section considers two epistemic\nthreats.\n\nThe first threat concerns disinformation created by malicious agents, like phishing\nmessages.\n\n**1** The second threat concerns factual failures and reasoning errors generated by genai\nsystems, referred to as \u2018hallucinations\u2019.\n\n**2** These threats can be thought of as human-made\ndisinformation and genai-generated misinformation, respectively.\n\nIn regard to human-made disinformation, regulations can be imposed on both the providers\nand users of genai systems.\n\nThe EU\u2019s 2022 Strengthened Code of Practice on\nDisinformation provides a set of guidelines for signatories to better self-regulate.\n\nCommitment\n15 provides that signatories can mitigate human-made disinformation by warning users of the\ngenai systems and proactively detecting such content.\n\nThis standard mirrors article 52(1) of the\n_Draft EU genai Act_ , which provides that, unless it is \u2018obvious from the circumstances and the\ncontext of use\u2019, providers must inform natural persons they are interacting with their genai\nsystems.\n\nTo prevent the distribution of manipulative content, article 52(3) provides that users\nof genai systems who create deepfakes **3** must disclose that they have been artificially generated.\n\nA report by the European Parliamentary Research Service690039_EN.pdf) notes that this labelling obligation\n\u2018could be a first step towards mitigating potential negative impacts\u2019, but is insufficient to\naddress other issues.\n\nThe _Draft EU genai Act_ neither contains guidelines for disclosure nor includes\nsanctions for non-compliance (article 71).\n\nFurther, it is unclear how actors sharing deepfakes\nanonymously would be held accountable.\n\n-----\n\nChina\u2019s \u2018 Provisions on the Administration of Deep Synthesis of Internet-based Information\nServices \u2019, which came into force on 10 January 2023, are instructive here.\n\n**4** These provisions\nprohibit persons from using genai systems to produce or disseminate false information\n(article 6); require the authentication of persons using deepfake technologies (article 9); and\nestablish mechanisms for refuting rumours created by such systems (article 11).\n\nPolicymakers should consider whether different sociopolitical conditions would affect the\nfeasibility of these regulations within their own countries.\n\nBecause Chinese internet users have\na greater \u2018digital fingerprint\u2019, as they are often required to link their online accounts to their\ngovernment-ID-linked phone numbers , malicious agents may struggle to conceal their\nidentities online.\n\nThere may be competing policy objectives, as suggested by measure 15.2 of\nthe 2022 Strengthened Code of Practice on Disinformation, which notes that policies to detect\nand sanction the impermissible use of deepfake technologies must be trustworthy and \u2018respect\nthe rights of end-users\u2019.\n\nWith respect to genai-generated misinformation, regulators ought to maintain a balanced\napproach.\n\nIn a blog post concerning GPT-4 , OpenAI acknowledged that \u2018new risk surfaces\u2019 will\nemerge as models become more powerful and their fields of content expand.\n\nIt is conceivable\nthat the complete eradication of hallucinations may be an unattainable objective.\n\nGreater\nattention is required in the EU to address this issue.\n\nAs has been observed elsewhere , the\noriginal proposal of the _Draft EU genai Act_ did not foresee the proliferation of genai\nsystems.\n\nThe _GDPR_ addresses this gap to a limited extent.\n\nIn circumstances where the\nhallucination provides false information about a particular individual, a claim may arise under\narticle 5 of the _GDPR_ , which provides that personal data must be accurate, and reasonable\nsteps must be taken to rectify or erase inaccurate data.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned\nscenario, the absence of provisions governing hallucinations presents a potential peril whereby\nindividuals may excessively depend on systems without engaging in discerning assessment of\ntheir outputs.\n\nIt must be noted that the providers of genai systems are not _entirely_ blameworthy for\nhallucinations in all circumstances.\n\nUsers may unintentionally pose a question in a manner that\ncauses the system to \u2018untether\u2019 from factual training data.\n\nFor example, when asked to provide\n\u2018at least five examples, together with quotes from relevant newspaper articles\u2019 of sexual\nharassment by American law professors, ChatGPT falsely listed the (real) George Washington\nUniversity Law School professor, Jonathan Turley .\n\nThe response (falsely) claimed that Turley\nwas a member of Georgetown University Law Center, citing a (non-existent) Washington Post\narticle that supposedly reported the harassment occurred during a class trip to Alaska (which\nTurley clarified had never happened before).", "As indicated within the recommendations section, regulatory measures aimed at mitigating\nthe incidence and associated hazards of hallucinations may necessitate comprehensive\ncoverage of both the development and utilization of genai systems.", "**2** **Privacy and Security**\n\nModels trained on personal data can generate highly realistic and identifiable information,\ncreating risks for privacy and security.\n\nThis concern transcends the realm of individual privacy\nand security, encompassing broader considerations.\n\nIn April 2023, Samsung banned their\nemployees from using ChatGPT following concerns that internal sensitive code that had been\nuploaded could be provided to other users.\n\n-----\n\nThe _GDPR_ is more relevant to privacy and security issues than the _Draft EU genai Act_ .\n\nThe GDPR\nrequires consent from individuals before collecting personal data (article 7); provides\nindividuals with the rights to access their personal data (article 15) and delete it (article 17);\nand contains measures to protect personal data from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure\n(article 21).\n\nSince March 2023 , OpenAI and the \u2018Garante\u2019\u2014Italy\u2019s data protection authority\u2014\nhave contested the lawfulness of ChatGPT\u2019s data collection processes.\n\nThis reveals the\nregulatory challenges that genai systems pose to the _GDPR_ .\n\nSpecifically, the Garante\ncalled for a range of measures concerning data processing , which sought to resolve four\nidentified breaches of the _GDPR_ .\n\nFirstly, OpenAI did not initially prevent minors from accessing\nChatGPT.\n\nSecondly, ChatGPT can generate inaccurate information about people (ie\nhallucinate).\n\nWhether the _failure to explain_ how personal data is processed, and _failure to_\n_explain_ responses that utilise personal data are, breaches of the _GDPR_ is a contested issue.\n\nThe\n\u2018right to explanation\u2019 is not mentioned in the _GDPR_ \u2019s articles, and the relevant Recital ( Recital\n71 ) has no legal force .\n\nNevertheless, article 5 of the _GDPR_ concerns erasure or rectification of\ninaccurate personal data.\n\nThirdly, users were not provided with an explanation as to how their\ndata was being collected.\n\nArticle 17 of the GDPR provides for the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 such\nthat an individual can request to have their data removed from the model.\n\nIt is worth noting\nthat an absolute \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 may be unattainable.\n\nThere are concerns that personal\ndata becomes embedded in genai systems , making it \u2018nearly impossible to remove all\ntraces of an individual\u2019s personal information\u2019.\n\nLastly, the large amounts of personal\ninformation being collected to train future iterations of ChatGPT could not be justified under\nany of the six bases in article 6(1) of the _GDPR_ .\n\nThe US Blueprint lists \u2018data privacy\u2019 as a guiding principle.\n\nThe Blueprint calls for privacy\nprotection by default, with an ongoing review for privacy risks; minimising data collection by\nconfining it to situations where it is \u2018strictly necessary to [achieve] the [system provider\u2019s]\nidentified goals\u2019; and ensuring best practices are followed to prevent data leaks beyond the\nconsented use case.\n\nFurther, the Blueprint outlines rights for the peoples whose data is being\ncollected, including the rights to access that data; know who has access to that data; correct\nthe data where necessary; and request the deletion of their data.\n\nCertain domains (eg health,\nemployment, education) are identified as deserving of enhanced data protection.\n\nThis includes\nan ethical review of sensitive data that may limit opportunities or access to services; auditing\ndata quality to ensure it is not inaccurate; limiting the extent to which sensitive data can be\nshared, sole or made public; and additional reporting requirements where necessary.\n\nChina\u2019s _Draft Measures for genai Services_ contains similar measures.\n\nThe consent of\ndata subjects is required for personal data used in the pre-training and optimisation of\ngenai systems (article 7(3)).\n\nFurther, providers must \u2018ensure the data\u2019s veracity,\naccuracy, objectivity, and diversity\u2019 (article 7(4)).\n\nOnce this data is collected, providers have an\nobligation to protect it and treat it appropriately.\n\nPursuant to the _lex generalis_ article 11,\nproviders must not \u2018illegally preserve input information from which it is possible to deduce the\nidentity of users, \u2026 conduct profiling on the basis of information input by users and their usage\ndetails, and \u2026 provide information input by users to others\u2019.\n\nLast, the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 is\nrecognised in article 13, which provides that providers must \u2018promptly handle individual\nrequests concerning revision, deletion, or masking of their personal information\u2019.", "**3   Bias and Disinformation**\n\ngenai systems can reflect biases present in their training data, entrenching\ndiscriminatory narratives.\n\nOne of the highlighted issues presented by experts is the importance\nof improving the transparency of genai systems.\n\nHowever, gaining complete insight into how\ngenai systems are trained may be an unattainable objective.\n\nThe combination of\ncomplex training algorithms, proprietary considerations, large-scale data requirements,\niterative processes, and the evolving nature of research and development pose challenges that\ncan limit transparency and make it difficult to fully understand the intricacies of the training\nprocess.\n\n-----\n\nThe European Commission has recently proposed auditing requirements for very large online\nplatforms (\u2018VLOPs\u2019) and search engines (\u2018VLOSEs\u2019), which would be inserted into the Digital\nServices Act .\n\nThe current proposal would impose an obligation on VLOPs and VLOSEs to\nprovide vetted researchers with privileged access to data; subject themselves to annual\nindependent audits; and publish reports on content moderation, risk assessments and risk\nmitigation.\n\nAt the time of writing, ChatGPT and other genai systems are not included\nin the list of 17 VLOPs or 2 VLOSEs.\n\nHowever, paragraph 29 of the proposal indicates that these\nsystems may be subject to requirements if they are used by the listed VLOPs and VLOSEs.\n\nIn\naddition, the newly proposed article 28b of the _Draft EU genai Act_ provides that foundation\nmodels\u2014which include genai systems like ChatGPT\u2014must contain \u2018only datasets that\nare subject to appropriate data governance measures\u2019.\n\nProviders of such models must\ntherefore take appropriate measures to examine the suitability of the data sources and\nmitigate possible biases.\n\nIn China, genai systems must \u2018respect social virtue and good public custom\u2019.\n\nThus,\narticle 4(2) of the _Draft Measures for genai Services_ provides that measures must be\ntaken to prevent discrimination \u2018on the basis of race, ethnicity, religious belief, nationality,\nregion, sex, age, or profession\u2019.\n\nThis must occur throughout the lifespan of the genai system,\nincluding during the stages of algorithm design, selecting training data, model generation and\noptimisation, and service provision.\n\nLastly, the US Blueprint lists \u2018algorithmic discrimination protections\u2019 as a guiding principle.\n\nThe\nBlueprint calls for a \u2018proactive assessment of equity\u2019 during a system\u2019s design phase;\n\u2018representative and robust data\u2019 that mitigates potential biases; proactive testing to guard\nagainst discrimination via proxy data; and disparity assessment and mitigation.", "**4   Intellectual Property Infringement**\n\nFinally, genai systems raise questions about intellectual property rights and the\nimplications of generating copyrighted works.\n\nProviders have already faced liability risks, with\nclass action suits having been brought against companies like Github for their code-generating\ngenai and Midjourney for their art-generating tool.\n\nSimilar regulations have been proposed across China and the US.\n\nIn China, article 4(3) of the\n_Draft Measures for genai Services_ provides that genai systems must \u2018respect\nintellectual property rights and commercial ethics\u2019.\n\nArticle 7(2) accordingly prohibits the use\nof data that infringes intellectual property rights from being used as pre-training or\noptimisation material for genai systems.\n\nIn the US, the proposed genai Risk Management\nFramework states that training data subject to copyright should align with relevant intellectual\nproperty right laws.\n\nMeanwhile, article 28b(4)(c) of the _Draft EU genai Act_ imposes an obligation on providers of\ngenai systems to publicly disclose the training data used that is protected under\ncopyright law.\n\nThis transparency provision was favoured over a blanket prohibition on the use\nof copyrighted material as training data.\n\nUltimately, this is a balancing act between protecting individuals\u2019 (intellectual property) rights\non one hand and fostering innovation on the other.\n\nThe application of copyright law to\nmachines\u2014as opposed to the human creative process\u2014raises a fundamental question moving\nforward: should copyright law protect an artist\u2019s creative expression or their style more\nbroadly?\n\nThis discourse has been further convoluted by the recent position adopted in Japan ,\nwherein copyrighted materials incorporated within genai datasets are exempted from the\npurview of copyright law, except in cases where such utilisation would unreasonably\njeopardize the rights of the copyright owner.\n\n-----", "#### Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nThe regulatory framework surrounding genai is characterised by rapid evolution.\n\nAs of the present\nwriting, the United States Government is actively soliciting public input for forthcoming genai\nregulations, while divergent opinions persist among experts within the genai community\nregarding the potential suspension of training activities for systems surpassing the capabilities\nof GPT-4.\n\nThis section presents a conclusive overview of the proposed methodologies aimed\nat regulating the aforementioned risks associated with genai.\n\nOf paramount importance is the\nproper categorization of these risks, distinguishing between the short-term and long-term risks\nposed by genai systems.\n\nAs mentioned already, this Policy Brief places high emphasis\non the short-term risks of the technology.\n\n**_Short-Term Risks_**\n\nShort-term risks pertain to the immediate hazards currently posed by genai systems.\n\nThis Policy Brief has examined four such risks.\n\n**_1.\n\nImpersonation and Disinformation_**\n\n1.1.\n\nFor users, inform them that they are interacting with genai systems.\n\n1.2.\n\nFor users, inform them of the genai system\u2019s limitations, which improves their ability\nto critically evaluate its output.\n\n1.3.\n\nFor users, establish platforms where they can refute the validity of harmful\ngenerated content.\n\n1.4.\n\nFor users, require identity verification before enabling access to genai\nsystems.\n\n1.5.\n\nFor providers, require detection procedures to identify malicious generated\ncontent.\n\n1.6.\n\nFor providers, require content produced by genai systems to be labelled\nas generated.\n\n1.7.\n\nFor providers, require \u2018stress testing\u2019 of models to test the vulnerability to\nhallucinations.\n\n**_2.\n\nPrivacy and Security_**\n\n2.1 For users, enable age-gating to protect the personal data of minors.\n\n2.2 For users, provide notice and require their consent to collect and use data for\ntraining purposes.\n\n2.3 For providers, minimise the amount of personal data collected for training\npurposes.\n\n2.4 For providers, allow users to opt-out of having their personal data used for\ntraining purposes.\n\n2.5 For providers, establish mechanisms that allow users to delete their personal\ndata from existing datasets.\n\n**_3.\n\nBias and Discrimination_**\n\n3.1 For providers, establish bias mitigation measures throughout the lifespan of their\nsystems, including the following stages: algorithm design, selecting training data,\nmodel generation and optimisation, and service provision.\n\n3.2 For providers, exercise enforcement on the disclosure of data training models.\n\n3.3 For providers, require regular independent audits and reporting on risk\nassessment and mitigation measures.\n\n**_4.\n\nIntellectual Property Infringement_**\n\n4.1 For providers, prohibit the use of training data that infringes intellectual property\nlaw.\n\nAlternatively, require reporting on copyrighted data that is used for training\npurposes.\n\n-----\n\n**_Long-Term Risks_**\n\nThe longer-term risk that genai systems _may_ pose is in accelerating society\u2019s arrival at\nArtificial General Intelligence (\u2018AGI\u2019).\n\nAGI refers to the ability of an genai system to perform a\nvariety of tasks in different contexts and environments.\n\nThe concept of AGI exists in contrast\nto our current, \u2018narrow\u2019 genai systems, which perform tasks in specified contexts.\n\nWithin the genai\ncommunity, there exists a division of perspectives regarding the fundamental inquiries\nsurrounding the feasibility of AGI and, if indeed attainable, the prospective timeframe for its\nrealization.\n\n**5**\n\nAssuming that AGI proves viable, apprehensions arise regarding its potential to profoundly and\nadversely impact humanity, potentially engendering existential perils.\n\nThese concerns demand\nequitable recognition and warrant further scrutiny.\n\nIn this vein, there are recommendations\nthat policymakers increase investment in \u2018 safety and alignment research \u2019 so that our\nunderstanding of genai\u2019s long-term risks keep pace with technological developments.\n\nNonetheless, it is of utmost significance to uphold the differentiation between short-term and\nlong-term risks, thereby averting potential diversions from the pivotal role that regulation may\nplay in offering remedies to the aforementioned risks.\n\n-----", "# Instructor Guidelines for Student Use of genai for Academic Work\n\nThe University of Southern California's Academic Senate Committee on Information Services\nrecommends that all USC schools, academic departments, and instructors adopt the following\nguidelines regarding student use of genai for academic work.\n\n_Instructors should encourage USC students to explore generative artificial_\n_intelligence (genai), using these new tools to create, analyze, and evaluate new_\n_concepts and ideas that inspire them to generate their own academic work.\n\nIn_\n_advance of this exploration, instructors should help students recognize that some_\n_contemporary genai-generated content may be specifically designed to appear_\n_plausible and persuasive but is sometimes factually inaccurate._\n\n_Many of the issues that have surfaced with the introduction of ChatGPT \u2013_\n_questions about academic integrity, authorship and citations, student_\n_engagement, misinformation and disinformation \u2013 are issues higher education_\n_and society have encountered in the past in response to the need for digital_\n_literacy.\n\nWe suggest that genai is simply the newest addition to USC\u2019s_\n_digital literacy tools._\n\n_Ultimately, this committee leaves instructors to set their own course policies_\n_regarding student use of genai.\n\nWhatever any given individual instructor_\n_decides should be clearly communicated to students in course materials._\n_However, the committee recommends that instructors remind students that the_\n_acquisition of academic work in whole or in part from any source (from textbooks_\n_and journal articles to web resources to genai) and the subsequent_\n_presentation of those materials as the student's own work (whether that material_\n_is paraphrased or copied in verbatim or near-verbatim form) constitutes an_\n_academic integrity violation unless otherwise allowed by the instructor._\n_Individual assignments and exams may have additional, specific requirements_\n_related to original work which should be clearly defined by the instructor._\n\n_Because genai is a constantly evolving space, the committee encourages_\n_USC\u2019s instructors to begin to learn more about genai so they can better_\n_adjust their pedagogy and evolve as educators._\n\nLast updated: 13 February 2023\n\n\n-----", "## Limitations of Guidelines\n\nOur focus in this document is narrow: to highlight the steps that USC\u2019s instructors need to take\ntoday to identify and to state their expectations with respect to student use of genai for\nacademic work.\n\nIn the weeks and months to come, we expect that USC\u2019s academic community\nwill be asked to participate in broader conversations about genai and its place in\nacademe and society.", "## What is ChatGPT and what can it do?\n\nIt is hard to overstate how much attention ChatGPT, a free\nonline artificial (genai) chatbot that generates text in response\nto prompts, has received since its launch on November 30.\n\nOne reason it has become so popular so quickly, surpassing\n100 million monthly active users to become the fastestgrowing consumer internet application in history , is the ease\nand speed with which it can generate text on demand.\n\nAsk\nChatGPT to \"write a five-paragraph essay on the impact\nJohn Stuart Mill's recantation of the wages fund doctrine had\non classical economics\" or \"explain what it means when\npeople say, 'knowledge is knowing that Frankenstein is not\nthe monster but wisdom is knowing that Frankenstein is the\nmonster'\" or \"write a sonnet about Clay Helton\" and it\ncreates plausible, human-like text responses in a matter of\nseconds.\n\nScholars, researchers, and educators have demonstrated that,\ngiven the right prompts, ChatGPT can\n\n\n\n-  Pass the final exam of an MBA-level Operations Management class at Wharton\n\n-  (Barely) pass questions on a law school exam at the University of Minnesota\n\n-  Pass all three exams that comprise the United States Medical Licensing Examination\n\n-  Pass Google's coding exams and interviews at the level of an entry-level software\n\nengineer with no prior industry experience.", "## Are students already using ChatGPT for academic work?\n\nYes.\n\nStudents are starting to use ChatGPT for their academic work.\n\nIn a late-2022 nationwide\nsurvey of 1,000 students currently enrolled in US colleges and universities , nearly one-third of\nthe students said they have already used ChatGPT to complete a written college assignment and\nnearly two-thirds of that group say that they have used it for 50% or more of their assignments.\n\nWe expect both percentages to be even higher today.\n\n-----", "## Are there other genai text tools like ChatGPT?\n\nYes.\n\n**ChatGPT is just the first in a wave of genai tools that will soon become**\n**ubiquitous.\n\n** genai is algorithms and tools\n\nthat can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text,\nsimulations, and videos.\n\nRecent new breakthroughs in the field have the potential\nto drastically change the way we approach content creation.\n\n( McKinsey &\nCompany )\n\nMost of these new tools rely on \u2018large language models,\u2019 genai systems that use advanced statistical\ntechniques to analyze and understand natural language data, such as text or speech, and generate\nhuman-like responses.\n\nMicrosoft, already a AIpowered Bing search engine and Edge browser major investor in OpenAI (makers of ChatGPT), launched a new in early February 2023 and intends to incorporate\ngenai-content generation into Microsoft Office programs like Outlook, Word, and PowerPoint.\n\nLater in 2023, Microsoft will release technology that will allow companies, schools, and\ngovernments to create their own custom ChatGPT-powered genai text generators .\n\nGoogle is\nexpected to launch its own ChatGPT competitor named Bard in early 2023.\n\nIn the summer of\n2022, Meta (formerly Facebook) released its Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) large language\nmodel to developers and researchers.\n\nAnd that is just the beginning (see\n for a list of hundreds of new genai tools that be used to generate text,\nimages, audio, and more).\n\nConsidering this, **we suggest that rather than focusing solely on ChatGPT, instructors**\n**should instead focus on what role they would like** **_all_** **genai tools to play in their**\n**classes and in their students' work going forward** **.\n\n**", "#### Embrace and Enhance\n\nThe good news is that many of the proven teaching and assessment techniques that worked in a\npre-genai world still work in a world where any student with a cell phone and a\ngenai account can create walls of academic(-sounding) text.\n\nUSC's Center for Excellence in Teaching (CET) recently published a guide titled \" Using genai text,\nimage, and music-generating tools in your courses \" that includes helpful ideas for incorporating\ngenai-generators and genai-generated content in your course, including evaluating and critiquing AIgenerated content (including interrogating the content for biases) and asking students to create\nrebuttals.\n\nLike our recommendation that students should use genai to create, analyze, and\nevaluate new concepts and ideas that inspire them to generate their own academic work, CET\n\n\n-----\n\nrecommends having your students use genai generators to brainstorm ideas, formulate and iterate\nquestion prompts, and refine responses, adding that you should\n\nFrame using genai tools as something to build upon.\n\nRemind students of the best way\nto use these tools in their discipline, such as for idea generation, essentializing,\nbrainstorming, or gathering information about the typical understanding of a topic.\n\nAll uses of genai tools should be supplemented with appropriate evidentiary support\nand reflection.\n\nSome students may lack the foundational knowledge to understand why or how genai-generated\ncontent is inaccurate.\n\nThis presents an excellent teaching opportunity for you to demonstrate for\nyour students genai's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nCET also offers several suggestions on designing assignments and assessments in the age of genai\ngenerators, including\n\n\n\n-  Asking more nuanced questions, beyond simple definitions and common comparisons,\n\nrelated to the course text, articles, media, or activities that may be unknown to or beyond\nthe capabilities of current genai generators,\n\n\n\n-  Having students complete assignments and assessments during class time,\n\n-  Requiring students to submit drafts of their papers or projects before they submit their\n\nfinished work, and\n\n\n\n-  Augmenting written papers with additional oral presentations, concept maps, group work,\n\nor case studies so that students can further demonstrate their understanding of the course\nobjectives.\n\nIf you are going to allow your students to use genai as a source in their academic work,\nyou may want to consider requiring your students to clearly disclose the role genai\nplayed in formulating their work.\n\nOpenAI also has recommended language that you may want to\nadapt and adopt:\n\nThe author generated this text in part with GPT-3, OpenAI\u2019s large-scale languagegeneration model.\n\nUpon generating draft language, the author reviewed, edited,\nand revised the language to their own liking and takes ultimate responsibility for\nthe content of this publication.", "#### Discourage and Detect\n\nSome educators have asked how they can block student use of ChatGPT (see New York City\nDepartment of Education and others ).\n\nWe suggest that that would be akin to standing on the\nshore hoping to block a rising tide.\n\ngenai is here and is not going away.\n\nThat said, **if you**\n**wish to** **_discourage_** **student use of genai, let your students know this expectation**\n**both in your syllabus and in class.\n\n** The guidelines listed at the beginning of this document\nshould serve as a good starting point.\n\nYou may also consider adapting and adopting something like _Science_ Journals' artificial\nintelligence (genai) policy :\n\n\n-----\n\nText generated from genai, machine learning, or similar algorithmic tools cannot be\nused in papers published in Science journals, nor can the accompanying figures,\nimages, or graphics be the products of such tools, without explicit permission\nfrom the editors.\n\nIn addition, an genai program cannot be an author of a Science\njournal paper.\n\nA violation of this policy constitutes scientific misconduct.\n\nAnother approach is _Nature_ Journals' large language model guidelines :\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, do not currently satisfy our\nauthorship criteria.\n\nNotably an attribution of authorship carries with it\naccountability for the work, which cannot be effectively applied to LLMs.\n\nUse of\nan LLM should be properly documented in the Methods section (and if a Methods\nsection is not available, in a suitable alternative part) of the manuscript.\n\nIn class, you can discourage student use of genai by encouraging students to use other\ntools and techniques instead.\n\nIn fact, many of the teaching and assessment techniques\nrecommended by the CET \u2013 ask more nuanced questions, have students complete assignments\nand assessments during class, require students to submit drafts, augment written papers with\nother activities that demonstrate students\u2019 content knowledge \u2013 work equally well if you want to\nembrace and enhance or discourage and detect student use of genai generators.\n\nHowever, we do not consider requiring handwritten assignments to be an effective technique to\ndiscourage or detect.\n\nStudents who have academic accommodations may need to use assistive\ntechnology in your class.\n\nProhibiting student use of technology or requiring that all students\nhandwrite their work may create a situation that singles out students with accommodations if\nthey can use technology while others cannot.\n\nAs for detecting if students' typed academic work contains genai-generated text, the best way is to\nhonestly grade that work and look for errors.\n\nSome, if not most, contemporary genai-generated text\nis specifically designed to appear plausible and persuasive but is not necessarily accurate .\n\nOpenAI cautions that \" ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or\nnonsensical answers .\"\n\nBecause of this, current generation genai text generators have the propensity\nto make easily discernable, fundamental mistakes that a subject matter expert or even an\n'experienced novice' would never make (see \" CNET's Article-Writing genai Is Already Publishing\nVery Dumb Errors \", \" Why Meta's latest large language model survived only three days online \",\n\" ChatGPT Needs Some Help With Math Assignments ,\" and \" Alphabet shares dive after Google\ngenai chatbot Bard flubs answer in ad \" for some recent examples).\n\nEven if students rewrite AIgenerated text to avoid detection, the structural and factual errors in current-generation AIgenerated text should remain.\n\nBut those detectable weaknesses may not last forever, especially\nwith future generations of genai text generators.\n\nAnother option is to use a 'similarity detector' (often mistakenly called a 'plagiarism detector')\nlike Turnitin.\n\nTurnitin, which is available in every USC Blackboard course, scans submitted text\nand highlights any phrases or paragraphs that are identical or closely like other sources known to\nTurnitin.\n\nSince some genai text generators have been known to copy from other sources without\n\n\n-----\n\nattribution \u2013 see \" CNET's genai Journalist Appears to Have Committed Extensive Plagiarism \" \u2013\ntools like Turnitin _may_ detect genai-generated text.\n\nOr not.\n\nTurnitin has announced that it will roll\nout additional, built-in genai writing and ChatGPT detection features soon.\n\nOpen genai, makers of ChatGPT, recently released their own genai Text Classifier tool at\n that \"predicts how likely it is that a piece of text\nwas generated by genai from a variety of sources.\"\n\nThe tool currently \"r equires a minimum of 1,000\ncharacters, which is approximately 150 - 250 words.\"\n\nPrinceton student Edward Tian also\ndeveloped a popular tool named GPTZeroX at  that \"highlights portions of\ntext that are most likely to be genai generated\" and allows you batch upload files \"in PDF, Word,\nand .txt format.\"\n\nOne word of caution: Students may be able to circumvent these tools.", "One word of caution: Students may be able to circumvent these tools.\n\nAs Melissa Heikkil\u00e4 noted\nin an article in the MIT Technology Review in December, \"[b]ecause large language models\nwork by predicting the next word in a sentence, they are more likely to use common words like\n'the,' 'it,' or 'is' instead of wonky, rare words.\"\n\nWith this in mind, Michael Webb at the National\nCenter for genai in Tertiary Education found a simple technique to fool many ChatGPT detectors ,\nincluding GPTZeroX:\n\n1.\n\nHave the genai text generator create some text.\n\n2.\n\nThen ask the genai generator to \"Use the word 'the' less\"\n\nWe tried this technique and were able to 'fool' both OpenAI\u2019s genai Text Classifier and Tian's\nGPTZeroX into claiming that text copied straight from ChatGPT was most likely written by a\nhuman and not genai.", "## Conclusion\n\nThe age of genai-generated content is upon us.\n\nIn a little over two months, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has\ncreated a 100 million user market for genai-generated text content that did not exist at scale last fall.\n\nAnd ChatGPT is just the first in a wave of genai tools that will soon become ubiquitous.\n\nBecause of that, rather than focusing solely on ChatGPT, we strongly recommend that instructors\ninstead focus on what role they would like all genai tools to play in their classes and in\ntheir students' work going forward \u2013 either by embracing and enhancing or discouraging and\ndetecting students\u2019 use of this technology.", "##

artificial\n\nintelligence.\n\nThere is a good possibility that using tools like these are going to become an important skill for\n\ncareers in the not distant future ( In the meantime though, it's going to take a while for society to figure out when using these tools\n\nis/isn't acceptable.\n\nThere are three reasons why:\n\nWork created by genai tools may not be considered original work and instead, considered automated\n\nplagiarism.\n\nIt is derived from previously created texts from other sources that the models were trained on,\n\nyet doesn't cite sources.\n\ngenai models have built-in biases (ie, they are trained on limited underlying sources; they reproduce, rather\n\nthan challenge, errors in the sources)\n\ngenai tools have limitations (ie, they lack critical thinking to evaluate and reflect on criteria; they lack abductive\n\nreasoning to make judgments with incomplete information at hand)\n\nGiven these (important) ethical caveats, some scholars in computational sciences debate if the hype over AIbased tools-- especially as \"automated plagiarism\" tools-- should be heeded at all\n\n( For the time being, I'm\n\ntentatively, pragmatically augmenting my

I expect you to use genai (e.g., ChatGPT, Dall-e-2) in this class.\n\nIn fact, some assignments will require it.\n\nLearning\n\nto use genai is an emerging skill, and I will provide basic tutorials about how to leverage it for our work.\n\nHowever, be aware of the limits of these software systems.\n\nB. genai is vulnerable to discrimination because it can inadvertently (or intentionally) perpetuate existing biases\n\npresent in the data it is trained on.\n\nFor example, if an genai system is trained on data that contains a bias\n\nagainst a certain group of people, the system may make decisions that are unfair or discriminatory towards\n\nthat group.\n\nC. There are several reasons why genai systems can perpetuate discrimination:\n\ni.\n\nBias in the training data: If the training data contains biases, the genai system may learn and replicate\n\nthose biases in its decision-making.\n\nii.\n\nLack of diversity in the training data: If the training data does not include a diverse range of examples,\n\nthe genai system may not perform well on diverse inputs, which may lead to discrimination.\n\niii.\n\nLack of transparency: Some genai systems can be difficult to understand and interpret, making it\n\nchallenging to detect and correct for biases.\n\niv.\n\nLack of accountability: Without proper oversight and accountability, it can be difficult to identify and\n\naddress discrimination in genai systems.\n\nv. It is important to keep in mind that these biases can be unconscious, unintended and hard to detect,\n\nbut they can have serious consequences if they are not addressed.\n\nD. genai can be a valuable tool for augmenting human decision-making and critical thinking, but it is not a\n\nreplacement.\n\nE. genai is a tool, just like a pencil or a computer.\n\nHowever, unlike most tools you need to acknowledge using it.\n\nPay close attention to whatever information you use in your own work that is produced from genai, and explain\n\nhow/what you used at the end of assignments.\n\nMy recommendation is to screen shot and save everything\n\n(i.e., what prompts you used, what answers were produced, where, why, and how).\n\nThis is new territory, but\n\nbasic attribution rules still apply.\n\nCite everything, otherwise you are likely violating academic integrity\n\npolicies.\n\nF.

as a catalyst for educational transformation\n\nThe Center for Integrative Research in Computing and Learning Sciences defines genai as:\n\n\u201cA branch of computer science.\n\ngenai systems use hardware, algorithms, and data to create\n\u2018intelligence\u2019 to do things like make decisions, discover patterns, and perform some sort\nof action.\n\ngenai is a general term and there are more specific terms used in the field of genai.\n\ngenai\nsystems can be built in different ways, two of the primary ways are: (1) through the use\nof rules provided by a human (rule-based systems); or (2) with machine learning\nalgorithms.\n\nMany newer genai systems use machine learning\u2026[employing] an algorithm\n\n[that] will identify rules and patterns in the data without a human specifying those rules\nand patterns.\n\nThese algorithms build a model for decision making as they go through\ndata.\n\n(You will sometimes hear the term machine learning model.)\n\nBecause they\ndiscover their own rules in the data they are given, ML systems can perpetuate biases.\n\n-----\n\nAlgorithms used in machine learning require massive amounts of data to be trained to\nmake decisions.\u201d\n\nWhile

evolving and doing so rapidly.\n\nConsiderations are thus offered without reference to specific genai applications (e.g., ChatGPT,\nDallE), retaining the focus on those considerations that would

Papini\n\nTuesday, December 12, 2023 Emerging Technologies and Trends\n\nEditors' Pick\n\n18 min read\n\nParticularly for new technologies that disrupt long-standing\npractices and cultural beliefs, the work of carefully and\nintentionally developing effective policies can pay significant\ndividends.\n\n-----\n\nCredit: vinnstock / Shutterstock.com \u00a9 2023\n\nPolicy creation might not be exciting, but it is essential,\nespecially when something new arrives on the scene and an\norganization does not have an easy or clear means of\nmodifying existing policies to accommodate the new\ndevelopment.\n\nOne such arrival happened in late November\n2022 with genai, and a year later, many colleges and\nuniversities are still scrambling to figure out an genai policy that\nworks at the institutional, departmental, and course levels.\n\n1\n\nNew technologies tend to follow a particular hype cycle,\nparticularly in higher education.\n\nHowever, the possibilities, 2\nproblems, and paradigms that genai tools such as\nChatGPT, Google's Bard, and Microsoft's genai-powered Bing\nrepresent are many and can touch every part of the institution\nand its stakeholders.\n\nHigher education focuses on building knowledge and investing\nin the written word, whether it's scholarly research or\n\n\n-----\n\ndemonstrations of learning such as essays, research papers,\ntheses, or dissertations.\n\nThe underlying assumption is that\nsuch work could not be significantly faked aside from paying\nanother individual (such as student paper mills) or taking the\nwork of others without attribution.\n\ngenai upends much\nof that baseline and in fact will challenge many institutions'\nacademic integrity policies because they often prohibit copying\nfrom websites or acquiring papers from other individuals.\n\ngenai will also introduce other ethical and procedures\nconsiderations throughout the institution.\n\nIn this article, we provide guidance and recommendations for\napproaching the development of institutional policy around\nusing genai tools in higher education.\n\nWe aim to help\nleaders in higher education institutions work more effectively\nto establish a pathway to a policy that includes various\nstakeholders and ultimately reduces the risk that members of\nthe institution will take policy matters into their own hands,\nresulting in problems for the entire institution.\n\n3\n\nThis piece evolved from our institutional roles (instructional\ndesign, writing support, and research and library support), our\nindividual work at our respective institutions, and a half-day\nworkshop on genai policy development that we\nfacilitated for the NERCOMP 2023 Annual Conference.\n\nThe\nworkshop included a student panel, followed by focused\nconversations around several topics related to genai:\nethics and plagiarism, bias, instructional technology,\nopportunities, and threats.\n\nFor the final part of the workshop,\nwe facilitated a mini design sprint for policy development.", "## The Need for Policy\n\n-----\n\nThe number of ways that genai tools can be used is\npart of what has drawn so much attention to them.\n\nIn higher\neducation, genai has been used for press releases\nabout students' deaths, for graduation speeches, and as tutors,\nto name a few examples.\n\nGiven the nature of knowledge work 4\nthroughout higher education, institutions need to determine\nwhere genai tools are appropriate and where they\nrepresent ethical or legal challenges.\n\nOne of the most pressing examples of areas for guidance is the\ndiscourse around plagiarism and how to detect it in an era of\ngenai-generated content.\n\nInstitutions are under pressure (whether\norganic or manufactured) to respond in some manner to the\nrise of genai as a widely available tool.\n\nThe first wave\nof awareness seemed to be generated around plagiarism\nconcerns and worker replacement theories (\"Students will\nnever write original papers again\" and \"Robots are replacing\neveryone\").\n\nFor those in higher education, the drumbeat of\nfearmongering about plagiarism has succeeded in capturing\nfaculty and administrative attention.\n\nEarly on, some assumed that genai work submitted by\nstudents could be identified with genai plagiarism\ncheckers.\n\nTurnItIn's documentation states, \"Our genai Writing\ndetector's false positive rate is less than 1% for documents\nwith 20% or more genai writing (our tests showed that in cases\nwhere we detect less than 20% of genai writing in a document,\nthere is a higher incidence of false positives).\"\n\nHowever, after 5\nthe TurnItIn genai Detector was used in practice, across 38 million\npapers, false negative and positive detections are now at a\nhigher risk.\n\nTurnItIn and other companies claim to offer 6\ngreater odds of correct detection than reality seems to bear\n\n\n-----\n\nout.\n\nAdditionally, further research is showing biases in what\ngenai-plagiarism detection tools flag as being genai generated,\nincluding an increased likelihood of inaccurately flagging\nmulti-language learners' work as having been generated by genai.\n\n7 Beyond the problem of false accusations, this environment\n\nalso creates an untenable situation for students who must\nsomehow defend themselves against a machine that cannot\nshow its work but is just a projection.\n\nAdditionally, students\nare using tools such as QuillBot, which will paraphrase text\nand use synonyms, to circumvent genai detection tools.\n\nAs original student writing becomes increasingly difficult to\nverify and confirm, developing a policy for genai detection might\nresult in its being outdated just as the policy is implemented.\n\nHaving an agile committee representative of diverse campus\nneeds who can both review these issues and considerations to\ncraft a more useful policy is part of what is needed to both\nprotect students and choose the right tools for navigating the\ntechnological changes.\n\nThis is but one issue that higher education needs to navigate\nwhen crafting policy around genai.\n\nOther issues\ninclude but are not limited to the following:\n\nThe role of genai in visual and textual outputs\nof the institution, be they for marketing, for social\nmedia, or in reports\n\nHow and where faculty can use genai in the\ncreation of course content, assignments, and feedback\nor assessments\n\nAddressing the embedded biases of the data and\noutputs 8\n\n\n-----\n\nThe impact and challenge of information literacy\n\n\nThe environmental impact of genai, including\ngreenhouse gasses 10 and water usage 11\n\n\nThe impact on workers 12 needed to run genai 13", "## Starting with the End\n\nIn many areas of life, including instructional design, an ideal\nplace to start is with the results\u2014what you want the outcome\nto be or do.\n\nTo feel that your\u2014and your collaborators'\u2014time\nhas not been wasted, and to see that you have made progress\ntoward what might still be an abstract version of achievement,\ncodify what success looks like for you, your collaborators, your\nstakeholders, and the final institutional arbiters.\n\nAs genai\ncontinues to develop at a rapid pace, it is important to pause\nand do enough research so that you can formulate the\nquestions you ultimately seek to answer.\n\nBelow are some\nquestions to get you started in thinking about this policy:\n\nWhom is the policy going to focus on?\n\nStudents,\nfaculty, staff, administration, third-party vendors,\ncontractors, etc.?\n\nCan the same policy apply across the institution, or will\ndifferent policies be needed for different parts of the\norganization?\n\nWill the policy stand on its own, or will there be room\nfor adjustments (for example, will students encounter\nvariations depending on whether instructors\u2014under\nthe notion of academic freedom\u2014want to encourage or\ndiscourage certain uses of genai for the\npurposes of teaching)?\n\n-----\n\nWhat can or will be the implications of violating the\npolicy?\n\nWhat methods of accountability with the policy can be\ncreated when it may be hard to actually detect\ngenai text?\n\nWill there be differences between institutionally\naffiliated generative tools and those that are available\nto anyone?\n\nPerhaps you are still in the fact-finding and idea-generating\nstage\u2014you might need to specifically dedicate time to consider\nwhat will constitute your goal for the mission.\n\nYou may decide\nthat success for your group means developing and writing\ndown these measurable goals.\n\nThat is, you might still be in the\nphase of brainstorming and research, and you might need to\ntake time to decide what your goals are.\n\nUltimately, all\ninvolved should agree on specific measurable outcomes that\nare necessary for your group to have completed your work.\n\nIt is natural to feel a sense of urgency to take action, and it\nmight be tempting to rush through this step.\n\nAlthough this\nprocess will not necessarily be easy, it will be helpful in\ncarving out exactly what you are going to do in this phase.\n\nOne\nof the trickiest parts about genai is that it has\ncontinued to change and shift in the past 12 months and will\nlikely continue to do so, especially as other forms of generative\ngenai (image, audio, video, slides, etc.)\n\nbecome increasingly\navailable.\n\nTherefore, no matter what your goals are, creating a\nmechanism for revisiting, adjusting, updating will be equally\nimportant to name and anticipate early on.\n\nIn that case, think in\n\n\n-----\n\nterms of not getting it perfect the first time through but having\na process to iterate.", "## Identifying Stakeholders\n\ngenai has the possibility of hitting every part of the\ninstitution.\n\nBecause it is difficult to imagine an area that\ngenai won't touch, it's useful to think about all the\ninstitutional stakeholders who will need guidance around\nusage of these new tools.\n\nStart by considering all the user\ngroups and their iterations at your institution.\n\nOne approach\nwould be to conduct an audit of your campus; if your institution\nhas an organization chart, that is a great document to use as\nthe foundation.\n\nSome people and groups are likely not\nrepresented, so detective work will come into play.\n\nThis is a\ngreat opportunity to break down institutional silos and\nexamine your own invisible biases about the roles others play\non our campuses.\n\nIdentify non-classroom student- and faculty-facing roles,\nwhich could include instructional designers, writing specialists,\nlibrarians, and academic support services.\n\nThen move on to\n\npeople whose work has an impact on the campus experience\nas a whole.\n\nThis could include staff working in IT (e.g.,\ninformation security, academic computing, or web services),\ninstitutional communications, student life, even alumni\nrelations.\n\nBe mindful that just because a group is not readily\nvisible to you does not mean that they will not be impacted by\nor have an impact on your policies.\n\nWe are a good example of\ncoming together to collaborate on genai policy.\n\nThe diversity of\nour professional perspectives has lent itself to not only seeing\ndifferent viewpoints but also creating the opportunity to truly\n\n\n-----\n\nunderstand the nuances in just how many ways genai is impacting\nour institutions.\n\nAn important early step should be to involve your\norganization's office for accommodations\u2014that is, the person\nor people who oversee the institution's support for people with\nlearning, cognitive, and ability differences.\n\nHistorically and\neven with genai, faculty and institutions often look to\nban a given technology without genuine consideration of why\nor how it might actually benefit students with disabilities or be\npart of a larger strategy involving universal design for learning.\n\nKeeping an awareness of ADA compliance and the ways that\ngenai can improve learning can only happen through\nintentional conversation with accommodation services on your\ncampus.\n\n14\n\nConsider, too, your contingent communities, such as part-time\neducators (adjuncts) and part-time staff.\n\nHow are they\nincluded in the community in general?\n\nDo they experience\nregular communication patterns as the full-time employees do,\nsuch as being included in campus-wide emails?\n\nWill you need\nto set aside time to engage them in discussion separately, and\nwill they need more training and professional development as\nyou enact the policies you create?\n\nLook for allies who can\nserve as conduits to get people involved.\n\nFor instance, adjuncts\nare often on campus for limited amounts of time during the day\nor might work elsewhere during typical business hours.\n\nWhen\nyou are scheduling conversations, be mindful that you will\nneed to create opportunities for those who work nontraditional\nschedules to be involved.\n\ngenai represents questions for the whole institution,\nwell beyond how it will be treated and used within\n\n\n-----\n\nclassrooms.\n\nThe administrative side of the campus will be\naffected by genai.\n\nVanderbilt University, for example,\nissued an apology after it was discovered that a 300-word\nemail (sent from the university's Peabody Office of Equity,\nDiversity, and Inclusion regarding the Feb. 13, 2023, mass\nshooting at Michigan State University) was composed using genai.\n\n15\n\nSome questions to consider for other entities at your institution\nmay include the following:\n\nWill the institution's upper management consider using\ngenai to surveil employees' work to detect\nefficiency or generate employee evaluations?\n\nShould your policymaking efforts account for this scale\nof institutional use?\n\nHow will genai be addressed in human resources,\nespecially the recruiting and hiring process?\n\nIn what ways will the community outside the campus\nbe impacted by your policies?\n\nDo you have community partnerships in which you offer\nstudents an opportunity to put their theoretical learning\ninto practice?\n\nDo you have an obligation to educate\nyour students on the uses of genai as part of\nthat collaboration?\n\nWill your institution be viewed as being a policy and\nposition leader on the subject of genai?\n\nWhat will be reasonable and equitable means of\nchallenging outputs by genai?\n\n-----\n\nFinally, one of the most visible and yet frequently overlooked\ncommunities is the students.\n\nThe value of engaging students in\ndetermining this policy cannot be overstated.\n\nTo craft a policy\nwithout their input could result in a policy that feels out of\ntouch and irrelevant to them.\n\nAt the NERCOMP workshop, the\nhighlight was hearing at the student panel how they\ndemonstrated their own deep and sophisticated thoughts\nabout genai and its roles in their lives.", "At the NERCOMP workshop, the\nhighlight was hearing at the student panel how they\ndemonstrated their own deep and sophisticated thoughts\nabout genai and its roles in their lives.\n\nIn particular, the\nconversation should extend beyond plagiarism and also\ninclude student perspectives about how other institutional\nareas should be using it (e.g., faculty, marketing,\ncommunications).\n\nMany students are aware of and interested\nin how genai is currently being employed in a wide\nvariety of industries.\n\nStudents might be reading about the way\nPaul McCartney used genai to restore John Lennon's\nvoice to create a \"new\" Beatles track, 16 or they may be\n\n\ninterested in how genai is being used to dramatically\nimprove recycling programs.\n\n17 These interests might be\n\ngeneral curiosity (to be encouraged!\n\n), but they might also tie\ninto students' future employment goals.\n\nThe consequences of not including a diverse array of groups in\n\nthese conversations far outweigh any inconvenience you may\nexperience when trying to find times and ways to gather input\nthroughout the policy development process.\n\nOur workshop\nincluded people from many of the groups mentioned, and a key\ntakeaway was just how much we learned from each other.\n\nMany realized that while something may seem obviously\nimportant to you, it may not even be considered by someone\nworking in a different position.\n\n-----", "## Models for Developing Policies\n\nDepending how an institution is structured and how much its\nleaders want to include different groupings within the\norganization, any of several models can be deployed to\ndevelop policies around genai.\n\nThe following options\nare useful approaches and, to some degree, can be mixed and\nmatched to meet the institution's needs and structures.", "### Task Force Model\n\nPut out a call to action to form an inclusive team representing\nall aspects of the institution to create a policy task force.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a smaller, nimbler team that works to\nengage with different stakeholders across the institution,\ncreating a template policy for genai and adjusting and\ntweaking it for each area of the institution, in conversation and\ncollaboration with relevant stakeholders.\n\nFor instance, the policy for students and faculty is likely to look\ndifferent from that of the marketing department, but\nrealistically all of these groups should have genai policies.\n\nThis\n\nmight seem self-evident for students, but there are important\nquestions to consider even for marketing, such as the use of\ngenai image tools to represent students.\n\nWould that\nadhere to the institution's ethos or marketing ethics?\n\nThose are\nthe kind of questions that would be relevant to marketing that\nstudents and faculty may not need to be involved in.", "### Governance Model\n\n-----\n\nSome institutions have governance models in which faculty\nand staff play pivotal roles in the development and creation of\ninstitutional policy, particularly around policies that directly\nimpact the classroom and students.\n\nThis can be a useful model\nto gather a range of voices throughout the organization and\nhave a clear pathway and record (e.g., committee notes) of how\ndecisions are made and implemented.\n\nYet these processes may\nencounter challenges in moving at an effective pace to make\ndecisions that are timely and responsive to a changing\nenvironment.\n\nDue to the rate of change in genai,\ncommittees might create policies for assumptions around\ngenai that are no longer valid.", "### Design Sprint Model\n\nCommonly used in IT and project management fields, the\ndesign sprint approach is another successful model.\n\nWe\nsuccessfully used this model in our NERCOMP 2023\nworkshop, and these steps can be adapted for institutional or\ndepartment use.\n\nAn effective design sprint includes six steps:\nUnderstand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, and Validate.\n\n18\nThis format of developing a policy based on feedback from the\ncommunity is more democratic in nature, allowing staff,\nstudents, and faculty to chime in with their ideas, thoughts,\nand recommendations.\n\n1.\n\nUnderstand: The first step is to understand how\n\ngenai is currently being used (or isn't) at your\ninstitution, the concerns of the community, and the\nideal state for genai use.\n\nThis can be achieved through a\nlistening tour, lighting talks, surveys, or structured\nconversations.\n\n-----\n\n2.\n\nDefine: Next, the policy team should review all the\n\ninformation gathered in the first step to define their\nmain goals and desired outcomes that reflect the needs\nof the community.\n\n3.\n\nSketch: Each individual on the policy committee should\n\nsketch out their own draft policy that meets the\ndefinitions outlined previously.\n\nThe larger committee\ncan then review all policy drafts and then narrow down\nthe ideas of each draft into a finalized Solution Sketch.\n\n19\n\n4.\n\nDecide: The policy committee will then review all\n\nSolution Sketches to decide which version they want to\nuse to move forward with the process.\n\n5.\n\nPrototype: The prototype can be considered the first\n\ndraft of the policy to be shared with the community.\n\n6.\n\nValidate: Return to the community members from the\n\nfirst phase of the design sprint process, gather\nfeedback based on your policy draft, and make relevant\nedits.\n\nThis is the last stage of the design sprint process,\nwhich will involve crafting the final version of the policy\nready to be shared with your institution.", "### Consultant Model\n\nSome institutions may seek consultants to research, discuss,\nand implement new policy based on developing industry\nstandards arising across academia.\n\n20 The value of a consultant\n\ncan be that an external voice with relevant knowledge and\nexperience provides a valuable perspective that helps folks\nthink differently about the challenge.\n\nHowever, it can also have\nthe opposite effect, wherein folks dismiss the consultant\n\n\n-----\n\nbecause of the costs involved, as well as concerns that an\noutside entity might not understand the context.", "### Exemplar Model\n\nAnother option is to follow the lead of institutions that are\npublishing their own policies.\n\nFor instance, Lance Eaton and his\nstudents have proposed and posted policies for College\nUnbound.\n\n21 Starting with one of these policies, the institution\n\n\ncan then review, share for input, and adapt as needed.\n\nThis can\nsave a lot of time in terms of coming up with the initial\napproach, but it will need to be tailored to the specific needs of\nthe institution and its population.\n\nIf the policy creation team is\nreluctant to borrow from another institution, they could use a\ngenai tool to draft the initial policy and workshop it\nacross the institution.\n\nWe used ChatGPT to generate several\n\n\nexamples\n\n\nof policies to help get you started crafting your\n\n\nown.", "## Recommendations for Gathering Voices\n\nTo create the clearest and most effective policy, all\nstakeholders' voices must be heard.\n\nBecause recruiting\nvolunteers for their insights in drafting a policy can sound\ntedious, consider using both formal and informal routes to get\ntheir assistance.\n\nAlso important is conveying how each\nstakeholder may be impacted by such a policy and\nemphasizing that their experiences and observations are highly\nvaluable to the process.\n\nAsking for help drafting a policy\n\n\n-----\n\ndocument can be overwhelming to many.\n\nThese approaches\nmight make this more engaging:\n\nConnect with people in mini roundtable discussions or\nsmall-group conversations\n\nFind help through social media\u2014use polling features to\ngenerate feedback and locate allies\n\nHave one-on-one conversations with the people you\nsee as your greatest supporters and greatest\nchallengers in this process.\n\nDiverse perspectives are\nnecessary to have a policy that works for everyone.\n\nAllow for enough time in discussions.\n\nIt can be easy to\nrush through things, but these discussions will include\ndeep topics and issues that need time to be fully\nprocessed.\n\nProvide collaborative documents for participants to add\ntext, and use the comment feature for questions or\nadditional thoughts.\n\nInstitutional knowledge is both an advantage and a\ndisadvantage in this process.\n\nSome stakeholders will be\n\nobvious, and some people will quickly volunteer.\n\nOthers may\nbe more challenging to reach because of their disinterest or\nbecause they don't see the relevance to their work.\n\nThese are\nimportant people to bring into the conversation, rather than\nmaking assumptions about their thoughts or possible\ncontributions.", "## Framework for genai Policy Creation\n\n-----\n\nBelow are the relevant sections that a genai policy\nshould address to help institutions in their policy development\nprocesses.\n\nEach institution should have its own individual\npolicy based on the needs of its community.\n\nPolicy Audience: Whom is this policy for?\n\nIs it for the\nentire institution, faculty, students, staff, departments,\nthird-party vendors, or others?\n\nPolicy Timeline: What is the timeline for\nimplementation?\n\nShould that timeline include a review\nand update cycle after initial implementation?\n\nPolicy Tools: What counts as genai for this policy?\n\nIs it\nfocused on all genai or only genai?\n\nIs it focused on\nall genai or just text-generating genai?\n\nAcademic Integrity Guidelines: If the policy is related\nto student or faculty work, what are the integrity\nrequirements to make sure academic integrity is\nupheld?\n\nAcceptable Use: If genai usage is acceptable, are there\nany limitations on the amount of usage (e.g., a certain\npercentage must be individually generated in certain\n\ncontexts) or purposes for which genai may be\nused?\n\nTransparency: What practices are in place for\ncommunicating its usage throughout the institution?\n\nSecurity and Legal Considerations: What concerns\nneed to be addressed concerning privacy, intellectual\nproperty, and proprietary knowledge around using\nexternal or enterprise genai tools?\n\nDoes\n\n\n-----\n\nendorsing the use of genai conflict with any\nlaws such as the General Data Protection Regulation?\n\nEthical Considerations: What concerns or\nresponsibilities does the institution have explicitly or\nimplicitly within its mission that conflict with the\nenvironmental, human-exploitation, and bias issues\nrelated to genai?\n\nInstitutional Resources: Which areas of the institution\nwill be committed to supporting, responding to, and\nimplementing uses of genai?\n\nProcesses for Policy Violation: If the policy is violated,\nwhat are the steps for identifying and addressing it?", "## Conclusion\n\nInstitutional policy development can often be a methodical\nprocess that both informs and better unifies an institution's\napproach to a particular challenge.\n\nAnd yes, it can be tedious.\n\nYet many institutions are often unprepared for technological\ndevelopments, and the delays in catching up have a deep\nimpact on students, faculty, and staff (e.g., the reactive\nresponse to the pandemic).\n\nAlthough the genai cat is\nout of the bag, there's still an opportunity to meaningfully\nguide\u2014through a collaborative effort\u2014how it can be best used\nby all the stakeholders.\n\nSuch an approach will result in a better\nlearning and working environment for students, faculty, and\nstaff.\n\nTaking an iterative approach to genai policy might feel\nunnatural for those who operate best with exhaustive policy\ndocuments, but it just might be the key to successfully\nnavigating this new technological reality.\n\n-----", "# Discussions of genai and ChatGPT in the Legal\n\nAcademy\n\nDespite the sturm

essential document for conveying expectations to your students.\n\nYou likely\nalready have policies around late work, attendance, and other aspects of your course, so it is highly\n\nrecommended that you think about how you might incorporate a policy related to A.I.\n\nuse into your\nexisting course structure.\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach here since courses differ vastly from\none another and there is wide variety in how instructors are incorporating A.I.\n\ninto their courses.\n\nBefore we present some specific examples, here are a few things for you to consider:\n\n**Having an A.I.\n\npolicy is important.\n\n** Some instructors allow any use of A.I.\n\nin completion of coursework while\nothers prohibit it entirely.\n\nIt is therefore very important for you to clearly convey when and how you allow use\nof A.I.\n\nin your courses, if at all.\n\nOtherwise, students may assume that the rules from their other courses also\napply in yours, which can lead to inadvertent violations of academic integrity.\n\n**You may have different policies based on assignment type.\n\n** You likely already have different sets of\nexpectations across the assessments in your course.\n\nFor example, textbook use is often encouraged on\nhomework but prohibited on exams.\n\nYou may end up with similarly distinct policies regarding A.I.\n\nuse.\n\nFor\nexample, it might be okay to use it for the brainstorming phase of a project but not production of the final\nwork.\n\nMaybe it could be useful for helping improve essays but prohibited on quizzes and exams.\n\nIf this is the\ncase, be very clear about when and how you allow A.I.\n\nuse.\n\n**Explain the \u2018why\u2019 behind your policy.\n\n** Generative A.I.\n\nis quickly becoming a commonplace feature in our world.\n\nIt is already being used in workplaces to speed up tasks, brainstorm ideas, organize concepts, and so many\nother things.\n\nBe clear about the value you place on your assignments in terms of learning value and explain\n\nwhy you place limits on A.I.\n\nuse in terms of how it would negatively impact learning.\n\n**Give guidance for citation of A.I.\n\n** If you allow students to use A.I., you may want to ask them for formal\n\ncitations of any text that was generated by A.I.\n\nas well as asking them to explicitly state how they used A.I.\n\nfor\nhelp.\n\nGuidance is becoming available for citation of A.I.\n\nusing formal styles like APA and MLA.\n\n**Ask for help.\n\n** If you\u2019re not sure how to get started or want to discuss your policy with someone, instructional\ndesigners at the CTT (contact-us) are available for consultation on this or any other teaching challenge you may\nbe facing.", "## A.I.\n\nSyllabus Policy Examples\n\nAs noted above, there are a wide variety of different approaches you can take to developing a syllabus policy\naround A.I.\n\nConsider the different types of assignments you have in your course, how they would be impacted by\nstudent use of A.I., and what reasonable limits you can put in place.\n\nExample policies tend to fall into 3 main\ncategories, as outlined below.\n\nThis page includes some examples of each type, but you can find many more on\nthis page of crowdsourced A.I.\n\npolicies .\n\n-----\n\nThese policies allow students to use A.I.\n\nin any way they\u2019d like to complete coursework.\n\nThese policies tend to\ninclude warning language about the likely pitfalls of turning in A.I.\n\ngenerated work without making any revisions.\n\nThe use of A.I.\n\ntools like Chat GPT is neither encouraged nor prohibited on assignments\nfor this course.\n\nIf you choose to use Chat GPT for assignments, please be sure to revise\nthe content for clarity, conciseness, and audience awareness.\n\nChat GPT is simply a tool\nand should not be used as a way to produce first and only drafts.\n\nEvery assignment\nsubmission will be graded using the rubric provided in the syllabus.\n\nBe aware that Chat\nGPT may not develop high-quality work that earns a passing grade.\n\nIt is your responsibility\nto review and revise all work before submitting to the instructor.\n\nWithin this class, you are welcome to use foundation models (ChatGPT, GPT, DALL-E,\nStable Diffusion, Midjourney, GitHub Copilot, and anything after) in a totally unrestricted\nfashion, for any purpose, at no penalty.\n\nHowever, you should note that all large language\nmodels still have a tendency to make up incorrect facts and fake citations, code\ngeneration models have a tendency to produce inaccurate outputs, and image generation\nmodels can occasionally come up with highly offensive products.\n\nYou will be responsible\n\nfor any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you submit\nregardless of whether it originally comes from you or an A.I.\n\nmodel.\n\nIf you use an A.I.\n\ntool,\nits contribution must be acknowledged in the work you hand in, and you will be penalized\nfor using A.I.\n\nwithout proper citation.\n\nHaving said all these disclaimers, the use of\nfoundation models is encouraged, as it may make it possible for you to submit\nassignments with higher quality, in less time.\n\nThe university's policy on plagiarism still\napplies to any uncited or improperly cited use of work by other human beings, or\nsubmission of work by other human beings as your own.", "### Use allowed under specific circumstances.\n\nThese policies allow students to use A.I.\n\nin some situations but not others.\n\nFor example, it may be allowed in\nparticular phases of a project but not others.\n\nIn other courses, it might be allowed on some types of assignments\nbut not all of them.\n\nIf you choose to apply this type of policy, be

are going to become an important skill for careers in the not distant future.\n\nFor my\nclass, a responsible use of A.I.-based tools in completing coursework or assessments\nmust be done in accordance with the following:\n\n1.\n\nYou must clearly identify the use of A.I.-based tools in your work.\n\nAny work that\n\nutilizes A.I.-based tools must be clearly marked as such, including the specific tool(s)\nused.\n\nFor example, if you use ChatGPT-3, you must cite \"ChatGPT-3.\n\n(YYYY, Month DD\nof query).\n\n\"Text of your query.\"\n\nGenerated using OpenA.I.. https:/ /chat.openai.com/ \"\n\n2.\n\nYou must be transparent in how you used the A.I.-based tool, including what work is\n\nyour original contribution.\n\nAn A.I.\n\ndetector such as GPTZero (https:/ /gptzero.me/ )\n\nmay be used to detect A.I.-driven work.\n\n3.\n\nYou must ensure your use of A.I.-based tools does not violate any copyright or\n\nintellectual property laws.\n\n4.\n\nYou must not use A.I.-based tools to cheat on assessments.\n\n5.\n\nYou must not use A.I.-based tools to plagiarize without citation .\n\n-----\n\nSome assignments in this course will explicitly state that you may use Artificial\nIntelligence (A.I.)\n\nsuch as ChatGPT when completing the work.\n\nUse of A.I.\n\nto produce or\nhelp develop content when an assignment does not explicitly allow for it is a form of\nplagiarism and will be treated as academic misconduct.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether\nsomething may be plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty, please reach out\nto me to discuss it

and practice.\n\nWe did not want to\n\nmix the topics, but most importantly we wanted to train the language model on select\u00ad\n\ned theories and practice, laying the foundations for an ongoing experimentation.\n\n-  \u0007 We assigned the theories and practices to the person with the strongest domain exper\u00ad\n\ntise (on average, each of us covered 3 areas).\n\n-  \u0007 We asked ChatGPT to provide output in the form of max 8 items for each prompt.\n\n-  \u0007 For Prompt #6 we asked ChatGPT to be creative when thinking of potential ideas for\n\ndisruption.", "**Human Curation:**\n\n-  \u0007 We challenged ChatGPT answers based on our hands-on experience (e.g., \u201cbased on\n\nour experience, we\u2019d add another pitfall\u2026 or we\u2019d rephrase the last pitfall because of\u2026\u201d).\n\n-  \u0007 We offered additional input, insights, examples (especially when ChatGPT delivered\n\nanswers we felt too generic).\n\n-  \u0007 We commented responses to help ChatGPT

inviting other experts and thinkers to join our experi\u00ad\n\nment, we would like to openly share a detailed list of our key takeaways.", "**PROMPTING**\n\n-  \u0007 Initially, ChatGPT may provide generic and superficial responses, but subsequent\n\nprompts can be used to improve its accuracy and quality.\n\n-  \u0007 When utilizing multiple sources such as books and articles, it is more effective to pres\u00ad\n\nent them as a context and then query ChatGPT \u201csource by source\u201d before requesting\n\nconsolidation.\n\n-  \u0007 Certain topics consistently appear throughout various theories/practices, and ChatGPT\n\nincorporates these recurring themes as part of its default model (e.g.\n\nintegrating da\u00ad\n\nta-driven insights, simulations, visualization, ethics).\n\n-  \u0007 Occasionally, ChatGPT may mix significant insights with less valuable information, so\n\nhuman intervention is necessary to curate and select the most appropriate responses.\n\nIf\n\ni f id d ki f b l i b h l f l\n\n\n-----\n\n-  \u0007 To provide updates to ChatGPT, specific excerpts from texts such as chapters, articles,\n\nor books can be entered.", "**REPROMPTING / REGENERATION**\n\n-  \u0007 When interacting with ChatGPT, it is important to request specific responses linked to\n\nthe context of the chapter, avoiding overly generic answers, and encouraging the use of\n\nkeywords related to the specific topic.\n\nThere are instances where it is necessary to guide\n\nChatGPT to consider certain aspects more thoroughly or refer to specific articles, parts,\n\nor more granular details within a broader theory.\n\n-  \u0007 ChatGPT tends to perform better when provided with a well-defined input to work\n\nwith, such as the \u201csix paths\u201d of the Blue Ocean Strategy or the main steps of the Discov\u00ad\n\nery Driven Planning approach.\n\nCustomizing the response in a timely manner based on\n\nsuch inputs yields better results.\n\n-  \u0007 While regeneration can help improve the rephrasing of answers, it may be less effective\n\nin generating significantly different responses.\n\n-  \u0007 After some time, ChatGPT may start repeating itself, requiring a change in the ap\u00ad\n\nproach or prompt structure.\n\nFor example, explicitly asking for less obvious or intuitive\n\nitems or exploring different perspectives can be beneficial.\n\n-  \u0007 It can be useful to provide ChatGPT with an \u201cadditive\u201d input, expanding on the initial\n\nlist or asking it to consider similar things or explore new directions.\n\n-  \u0007 Requesting concrete examples is important, as ChatGPT rarely generates them on its\n\nown.\n\nOften, the value of the response lies in the provision of specific, detailed, and tan\u00ad\n\ngible examples.", "**TONE/NARRATIVE**\n\n-  \u0007 ChatGPT often includes unnecessary pleonastic padding, resulting in the use of two or\n\nthree sentences when one would suffice.\n\n-  \u0007 It may be beneficial to ask ChatGPT for a more engaging or fitting rephrasing related to\n\nthe topic, as its default responses can be somewhat flat, repetitive, and uninteresting.\n\n-  \u0007 The \u201cregenerate\u201d function can be employed to modify specific items, allowing for the\n\nrephrasing of answers by shortening, expanding, or making them less verbose through\n\nthe use of examples\n\n\n-----\n\n-  \u0007 Creating narrative pieces by initially providing inputs or keywords helps establish the\n\nnecessary connective structure, which can be further refined through multiple rounds\n\nof regeneration and requests for shorter or longer responses.\n\n-  \u0007 Additionally, fine-tuning can be employed to correct the wording in a more targeted\n\nmanner (by instructing ChatGPT on the desired style), followed by the incorporation\n\nof personal touches.", "**CREATIVITY**\n\n-  \u0007 ChatGPT demonstrated an impressive level of creativity, in some cases better than\n\nmany domain experts.\n\n-  \u0007 When seeking disruptive thinking, encourage ChatGPT to explore extremes by re\u00ad\n\nquesting \u201cwild ideas\u201d that are radically different or unconventional.\n\n-  \u0007 If after some iterations ChatGPT becomes more predictable, it can be helpful to explic\u00ad\n\nitly prompt it to be more creative and to look \u201coutside the box\u201d.\n\n-  \u0007 In first place, for ChatGPT the notion of \u201cdisruption\u201d tends to be associated with tech\u00ad\n\nnological disruptions (such as AR/VR, blockchain, etc.\n\n), therefore prompt it to also ex\u00ad\n\nplore ideas that are not necessarily driven by technology.\n\n-  \u0007 Sometimes ChatGPT may propose similar patterns/ideas for different theories.\n\nWhen\n\nthis happens, ask ChatGPT to better customize the idea to the specific context, adding\n\nconcrete examples.", "**CONTENTS / COGNITIVE BIAS**\n\n-  \u0007 In the responses, the logic behind the sequence of the various bullets is often unclear.\n\nBy applying deliberate pressure and requesting clarification, it is possible to gain a bet\u00ad\n\nter understanding and encourage ChatGPT to organize the information in a more log\u00ad\n\nical and coherent manner.\n\n-  \u0007 ChatGPT may not be accurate in the distinction between genai and GenAI and between genai\n\nand other technologies, such as blockchain or VR/AR (where an genai component exists).\n\n-  \u0007 When ChatGPT is given a corrective input, it tends to incorporate it explicitly in subse\u00ad\n\nquent answers, seemingly aiming to please and satisfy the user.\n\nTherefore, it is import\u00ad\n\nant to exercise judgment when providing corrective inputs\n\n\n-----\n\n-  \u0007 ChatGPT sometimes may struggle to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between different theories\n\nand practices.\n\nWhen this happens, it\u2019s useful to explicitly prompt it to look for analogies\n\nand connections.\n\n-  \u0007 ChatGPT has not displayed any significant errors or hallucinations that could be con\u00ad\n\nsidered major mistakes in its responses.", "**HUMAN JUDGEMENT**\n\n-  \u0007 When evaluating responses and selecting generated items, it is crucial to possess strong\n\ndomain expertise and maintain critical judgement.\n\nThis is necessary because ChatGPT\n\ntends to mix valuable insights (\u201cgems\u201d) with less valuable information.\n\n-  \u0007 Assessing the effectiveness of response phrasing also requires experience and familiar\u00ad\n\nity with business jargon.\n\nThis expertise is essential to determine the appropriateness\n\nand relevance of the language used.\n\n-  \u0007 For individuals with robust domain expertise, ChatGPT can serve as an excellent source\n\nof inspiration.\n\nIt can act as an engaging sparring partner, stimulating motivational flow\n\nand generating intriguing insights.\n\n-  \u0007 Overall, ChatGPT is an amazing tool for generating lists of items and ideas that can be\n\nfurther screened, refined, and evaluated.\n\n|Col1|SUMMARY OF THE KEY LESSONS LEARNED|\n|---|---|\n|Prompting|\u2022 In general, finding the

Chan Kim and Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne.\n\nIt suggests that companies can achieve re\u00ad\n\nmarkable success by creating new markets instead of competing in existing ones.\n\nThe\n\ntheory emphasizes the pursuit of uncontested market spaces, known as \u201cblue oceans\u201d,\n\nwhere competition is irrelevant or non-existent.\n\nBy identifying customer needs and\n\npain points and offering unique value propositions, companies can create new demand\n\nfor their offerings.\n\nIn practice, Blue Ocean Strategy methodology follows some key steps: analysis of the\n\ncurrent Industry, identification of unmet customer needs; design of a Value Curve; ex\u00ad\n\nploration of new market spaces; development of a Business Strategy.\n\nBlue Ocean Strategy is part of the broader Business Model Innovation concept, the pro\u00ad\n\ncess of creating, modifying, or redefining a company\u2019s business model to achieve superi\u00ad\n\nor performance or gain a competitive edge.\n\nTo this regard, a relevant management tool is\n\nthe Business Model Canvas , popularized by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur: it\n\nallows organizations to define, visualize, and refine their business models.\n\n-----", "**Our hands-on experience**\n\nAs long-term partners and contributors of the Blue Ocean Strategy Network , we have\n\napplied the methodology on dozens of firms across various industries and sectors world\u00ad\n\nwide, with established large companies and with smaller ones.\n\nWe have witnessed the transformative power of Blue Ocean Strategy: simple and effec\u00ad\n\ntive framework and visual tools, a clear process to follow, the ability to foster a culture of\n\ncreativity and innovation within organizations, encouraging employees to think outside\n\nthe box.\n\nDuring its application we have often observed organizations struggling in terms of:\n\nCustomer understanding: organizations may struggle to fully grasp the needs, prefer\u00ad\n\nences, and behaviors of their target customers.\n\nLack of market research, inadequate cus\u00ad\n\ntomer feedback channels, or a failure to analyze and interpret customer data can con\u00ad\n\ntribute to this challenge.\n\nInternal biases: organizations can face difficulties in overcoming preconceived notions\n\nabout their industry, customers, or competition.\n\nThese biases can prevent the explora\u00ad\n\ntion of new opportunities, as decision-makers may be hesitant to deviate from estab\u00ad\n\nlished practices.\n\nQuantification of qualitative insights: translating qualitative insights, such as customer\n\nfeedback, into quantitative data can be a complex task for organizations.\n\nThe inability\n\nto quantify these insights makes it challenging to prioritize opportunities and make da\u00ad\n\nta-driven decisions.\n\nComplexity in implementation: organizations often encounter challenges when moving\n\nfrom strategy formulation to implementation.\n\nThis can be due to

measurement\n\nand interpretation of results.\n\n-  \u0007 Difficulty in deriving actionable insights: surveys can provide valuable data on employ\u00ad\n\nee motivation but converting them into actionable strategies is challenging because of\n\nthe complex nature of motivation.\n\n-  \u0007 Perception that motivation is qualitative without a business case: numerous studies have\n\nshown a strong link between employee motivation and business outcomes such as pro\u00ad\n\nductivity, retention, and customer satisfaction, but this connection is not yet obvious.\n\nTo help firms overcome these challenges we supported the development of a practical\n\napproach called \u201c kindness triangle \u201d.\n\nAt the base of the triangle are motivation and wellbeing indicators.\n\nAt its top are business\n\nresults.\n\nEvery vertex of the triangle has an associated set of indexes, with analytical cor\u00ad\n\nrelations linking the three vertices.\n\nThe logic is that a compassionate

of genai in Higher Education\n\ngenai has the potential to transform, and perhaps even revolutionize, education.\n\nWhile much of\nthis is still speculative\u2014as genai tools continue to proliferate and educators learn to harness their power\u2014\nthere are several potential educational benefits of genai that are repeatedly mentioned in the\nliterature.\n\nThe broad argument is that genai will free instructors from mundane and repetitive\ntasks, allowing them to spend more time creating immersive and engaging learning experiences geared\ntoward the individualized needs of students.\n\nAs educators gain genai literacy, it could lead to even more\nprofound shifts in how they create content, teach, and engage students.\n\nThe following section\nsummarizes some of the primary ways technology leaders predict genai will change education.\n\n**Educational Enhancement.\n\n** genai can enhance education, making it more engaging, accessible,\nand tailored to individual student needs.\n\ngenai, for instance, can put classroom skills and\nknowledge into practice through the generation of interactive learning simulations (Lebo & Brown,\n2023).\n\nFor example, medical students might \u201cinteract\u201d with a genai trained to mimic the\nsymptoms of a patient.\n\nSuch simulations can enhance the realism of learning objectives, providing\nopportunities for faculty to tailor scenarios to class content and student learning needs.\n\ngenai\ncan also serve as a personalized tutor.\n\nFor instance, Khan Academy, a non-profit learning platform for K12 students, has partnered with OpenAI to create an genai guide that serves as a tutor and student coach in\nmath, computer science, and writing topics.\n\nWith the proper IT infrastructure faculty could use\ngenai to tailor content and feedback to students based on their needs and learning styles (Seo et\nal., 2021).\n\nThese genai tools can also \"engage\" with learners, for example, by helping students practice\nlanguage skills by interacting with an genai through customized conversation-like responses (Kharbach,\n2023) or by making revision suggestions to submitted text, according to the users' prompts.\n\nThese\npersonalized, interactive uses of genai can enhance student engagement and improve learning\noutcomes (Adiguzel et al., 2023).\n\n-----\n\n**Instructor Empowerment and Skill Development.\n\n** Instructors could use genai tools to create a\nrange of curricular materials, like syllabi, assignments, test and quiz questions, case studies, self-paced\npractice problems, and study guides, as well as administrative and professional documents like memos,\nreports, proposals, self-assessments, and visual presentations (Pavlik, 2023; Gupta & Bhaskar, 2020).\n\nFurthermore, educators can assist students with learning needs by utilizing genai tools with text-to-speech\nor speech-to-text functions (Dillard, 2022; Kasneci et al., 2023; Tilili et al., 2023).\n\nBeyond creating\nmaterials, genai technologies may foster improved teaching skills and competency by providing inspiration,\npromoting self-reflection, and granting deeper insights into students' learning processes (Adiguzel et al.,\n2023).\n\nFor instance, genai-generated metrics can provide instructors with detailed analytics on each\nstudent's performance, such as the type of questions they ask or the amount of progress they have\nmade in a course.\n\nWith such metrics, faculty can refine assignments, better target areas of difficulty for\nstudents, and create tailored learning paths.\n\n**Enhanced Academic Research.\n\n** genai technologies (such as scite.genai, elicit.org, consensus.app, and\nsemanticscholar.org) are valuable tools for researchers (Mariani, 2021).\n\ngenai applications can help\nstreamline and automate the process of collecting research, writing literature reviews, and enabling\nknowledge discovery (Mariani, 2021).\n\nUpon analyzing a given text, genai has the ability to\ngenerate informative research questions.\n\ngenai-powered tools can also synthesize and organize large\namounts of research data, concisely summarizing research findings (Heid, 2023).\n\nWith genai-supported\nresearch, faculty can generate more detailed results and efficiently manage data.\n\ngenai-enhanced research\nmethods can also be used to identify patterns and trends that would be difficult to identify manually,\nallowing faculty to explore research areas they might not have considered.\n\n**Increased Efficiency.\n\n** genai technologies (such as Microsoft Co-Pilot) can automate various\nroutine tasks, allowing staff and faculty to focus their time on other important activities.\n\nFor example, genai\ntools can automate the gathering of data, the development of reports, and the scheduling of meetings\nand events, all of which can help instructors and staff save time.\n\n**Content Creation.\n\n** The ability of generative AIs to create content has the potential to alter education in\nat least two ways.", "**Content Creation.\n\n** The ability of generative AIs to create content has the potential to alter education in\nat least two ways.\n\nFirst, as mentioned above, instructors can use these tools to quickly and efficiently\ncreate a range of curricular and professional materials (Pavlik, 2023; Gupta & Bhaskar, 2020).\n\nSecond,\nstudents can use these tools to respond to writing assignments and prompts during different parts of\nthe writing process.\n\nWhile it is essential for students to understand the limitations and biases of content\ncreated by generative AIs, the value of effective prompt engineering, and the importance of critiquing\nand revising genai outputs, these genai tools have the potential to enhance student writing as engaged\nlearning (Hesse, D. et al., 2023; Byrd, A. et al., 2023; Selber, 2023).", "# Section 4: Risks and Challenges of genai\n\nIt is important to be aware of and mitigate the potential risks and ethical concerns associated with the\nuse of genai in educational environments.\n\nThese concerns have led 1,000 technology leaders to\ncall for a six-month halt in \"giant\" genai experiments (Metz and Schmidt, 2023).\n\nIn addition, there is\nconcern that genai developers are creating applications that are difficult to understand, predict, and reliably\ncontrol.\n\nThese concerns include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n**Transparency:** A lack of transparency into the source data and how the responses are generated could\nmake these genai models difficult to explain and understand.\n\nFor example, a genai\nsolution that summarizes the literature about engaged learning may not be able to reference the right\narticles that led it to its conclusions about the data.\n\nThat's why being able to verify the information\n\n\n-----\n\nproduced by genai is an essential skillset to develop and build.\n\nHow can we help our students\ncritically assess genai output quality?\n\n**Overreliance:** Overreliance on genai systems can lead to several negative consequences, such as users\nuncritically accepting incorrect genai outputs; loss of critical thinking skills; inhibiting users from developing\noriginal ideas; misunderstanding concepts; inability to apply knowledge; detachment from the inquiry\nprocess; limited exposure to diverse perspectives; and users losing confidence that they can learn on\ntheir own without the assistance of genai (OpenAI, 2023; Passi & Vorvoreanu, 2022).\n\nHow can we train our\ncommunity to use strategies for mitigating user overreliance on genai and help students develop\nframeworks for interacting successfully with genai systems?\n\n**Academic Integrity** : It is reasonable to assume that students have been utilizing genai\ntechnologies to complete their class assignments.\n\nHowever, given the speed with which genai emerged\nduring this last academic year, it is also reasonable to assume that most faculty members\nunderstandably did not incorporate an \"Acceptable genai Use\u201d policy into their syllabi.\n\nThis creates an\nacademic integrity gap that could be addressed by clear expectations around genai use in\nacademic settings.\n\nHow can we prepare our community to address the academic integrity gap?\n\n**Misinformation Concerns** : The rise of deep fake images and videos and manipulation of information\npose a major near-term threat that calls for genai regulations from the US government and close attention\nfrom educational institutions.\n\nStudies have already demonstrated the ability of machines to produce\nimages and sounds nearly identical to their real-life counterparts (Metz and Blumenthal, 2019).\n\nSuch\nadvancements could potentially hasten the propagation of misleading or false information.\n\nHow can we\nhelp our community to mitigate the risks of deep fake materials?\n\n**Output Quality:** While the answers generated by genai may seem logical and accurate, there can be\ninstances where the information produced is incorrect, a phenomenon often referred to as a\n\"hallucination.\"\n\nIt is therefore crucial for students to cross-check genai-generated information with reliable\nexternal sources.\n\nMoreover, content produced by genai can be harmful and biased, as the data\ntraining the model represents data sources that includes bias.\n\nAdditionally, these tools have been\nprimarily trained on Western perspectives and may not present a globally inclusive view.\n\nHow can we\nhelp our community develop a clear understanding of the limitations of genai?\n\n**Equity and Access** : Some genai tools are freely available, but more advanced models like GPT-4\nare subscription based.\n\nEnsuring that all students, faculty, and staff have equal access to tools like\nChatGPT and the training to use them effectively is a critical step in bridging the digital divide on\ncampus.\n\nWhat infrastructure do we need to build to ensure equitable access to these tools?\n\n**Job Loss** : The impacts of genai on the job market, both in the short- and long-term, remain\nuncertain.\n\nWhile some studies show significant productivity gains (McKinsey, 2023), others indicate\npotential disruptions in specific labor sectors, which may impact students, staff, and faculty.\n\nHow can we\nhelp our community use genai to strengthen their professional lives while mitigating any potential\ndownsides?", "**1.\n\n** **Understand the Opportunities and

the GAIA policy stresses transparency, fairness, and\nobligations for both students and teachers.", "## The genai Assistance (GAIA) Policy\n\nWe welcome genai language-generation tools (collectively, large language models, or LLMs) into the\nlearning process, in a way that preserves fairness, optimizes student skill building, and honors relevant\nstakeholder perspectives.\n\nThese include our own perspectives as students eager to learn and build\ncareers, and the perspectives of our families who send us to university, our professors who are charged\nwith teaching us vital skills, our university that has a responsibility to attest to our competency with\ndiplomas, our future employers who invest in us because of our abilities and character, and our\ncolleagues who lack privileged access to valuable resources.\n\nTo that end, the GAIA policy adopts a few\ncommonsense limitations on an otherwise embracing approach to LLMs.\n\n1.\n\nAs students, we should give credit to LLMs whenever they are used, even if only to generate\nideas rather than usable text.\n\n2.\n\nWhen writing papers or take-home assignments using LLMs, we should include in an\nappendix our entire exchange(s) with the LLM, highlighting the most relevant sections.\n\nWe\nshould write a narrative at the beginning of the appendix explaining precisely _how_ we used\nthe LLM (to generate ideas, turns of phrase, elements of text, long stretches of text, lines of\nargument, pieces of evidence, etc.).\n\nThis narrative should also explain _why_ we used the LLM\n(to save time, to surmount writer\u2019s block, to stimulate our thinking, to handle mounting\nstress, to clarify prose, to experiment for fun, etc.).\n\n3.\n\nWe should not use LLMs to help with in-class examinations, tests, or assignments, unless\nthey are explicitly organized around an LLM (e.g.\n\nan in-class assignment might challenge\nstudents to elicit from a LLM the most profound statement on the future of genai).\n\n4.\n\nIf we choose to use an LLM, we should use it wisely and intelligently, aiming to deepen our\ngrasp of the subject matter and to support our learning.\n\n-----\n\n5.\n\nOur professor should seek to understand how LLMs work, including their strengths and\nweaknesses, as well as tools for detecting LLM-generated output, in order both to optimize\ntheir value for our learning, and to incorporate that awareness into grading procedures.\n\n6.\n\nOur professor should:\na.\n\nTreat work submitted by students who declare no use of LLMs as the baseline for\n\ngrading.\n\nb.\n\nUse a lower baseline for students who declare use of LLMs, depending on how extensive\n\nthe usage, while rewarding creativity, critical nuance, and the correction of factual\ninaccuracies or superficial interpretations in response to suggestions made by the LLM.\n\nc. Employ genai-text-generated-detection tools to evaluate the degree to which machine-\n\ngenerated text is likely to be present in student work.\n\nd. Impose a significant penalty for low-energy or unreflective reuse of wording generated\n\nby LLMs, to the point of assigning zero points for merely reproducing LLM output.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n-  We acknowledge that some may prefer stronger restrictions on the use of LLMs, and therefore\nthat the GAIA policy may make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n-  We acknowledge that some aspects of this policy are non-enforceable and depend on goodwill,\na sense of fairness, and honorable character.\n\n-  We acknowledge that this policy will need to be revisited when subscription versions of LLMs\nbecome available, which may be affordable for some students but not for others.\n\n-  We acknowledge that this policy may need to be revised in light of other policies that would\nsupersede it or due to novel technological developments.\n\n-----", "**Contextualizing LLMs in terms of Recent genai Advances**\n\nAlthough we describe the text generation procedure above, many questions still need to be\naddressed: How do language models function internally?\n\nHow are the output probabilities for\nthe next word determined?\n\nWhat goes into creating (and indeed using) a language model?\n\nHow\nare language models different from more traditional predictive models if all they do is predict the\nnext token?\n\nWe address these questions indirectly in the present section by taking a tour of the essential\nsignificant developments in machine learning and genai that have occurred in the\nlast decade and have fueled the creation of modern large language models.\n\n**_Classical Machine Learning as Prediction Machines_**\n\nWe start with the most well-understood subset of machine learning techniques: supervised\nlearning.\n\nThe central objective in supervised learning is to produce a prediction rule that predicts\nwell on unseen data, given enough labeled examples.\n\nFor example, consider predicting house\nprices from the square footage in a given zip code.\n\nInstead of creating a hand-crafted prediction\nrule, the machine learning methodology advocates for choosing a prediction rule from an\nexpressive but non-exhaustive class of rules, such as linear predictors, that provides the best fit\non an existing collection of size-price examples.\n\nThe statistically well-substantiated leap of faith\nhere is that we expect (or at least hope) that a parsimonious prediction rule that predicts well on\ncollected data, for which we know the correct answers, continues to maintain its predictive edge\non unseen data, where answers or prices are unknown.\n\nSuch a predictive methodology benefits\nfrom an abundance of labeled examples, hoping that a prediction rule learned from more\nexamples is more robust in that its superior predictive performance on seen data is less\nascribable to chance alone.\n\nAnother example of a supervised learning task is to separate spam\nfrom non-spam mail, given the text in email messages.\n\nAgain, having more examples of spam\nand non-spam emails is helpful to a supervised learning algorithm.\n\n-----\n\nKaran Singh, Assistant Professor of Operations Research\n\n\nFigure 5: Predicting house prices from square footage.\n\nPictured is a linear\n\n\nregression, an example of a supervised learning algorithm that uses extant\n\n\ndata to learn a linear predictor.\n\nCharacteristics common to both language models and supervised learning:\n\n1.\n\n**_Predicting Well is the Yardstick._** A prediction rule is good as long as it makes\nreasonable predictions on average.\n\nCompared to more ambitious sub-disciplines in\nstatistics, any statements about causality, p-values, and recovering latent structure are\nabsent.\n\nWe are similarly impervious to such considerations in language models.\n\nSuch\nsimplicity of goals enables very flexible prediction rules in machine learning.\n\nAlthough\nseeming modest in its aim, the art of machine learning has long been to cast as many\ndisparate problems as questions about prediction as possible.\n\nPredicting house prices\nfrom square footage is a regular regression task.\n\nBut, for reverse image captioning, is\n\u201cpredicting\u201d a (high-dimensional) image given a few words a reasonable or well-defined\nclassification task?\n\nYet, this is how machine learning algorithms function.\n\n2.\n\n**_Model Agnosticism._** Supervised learning algorithms realize the adage that all models\nare wrong, but some are useful.\n\nFor example, when building the price predictor above, a\ndata scientist does not believe that the genuine relationship between prices and area is\nlinear or well-specified.\n\nSimilarly, when using neural networks to predict the next word in\nlanguage models, we don\u2019t believe that this is how Shakespeare must have employed a\nneural network to compose his texts.\n\nYet, there are crucial differences:\n\n\n-----\n\nKaran Singh, Assistant

data in a particular sense,\nnamely that any fixed example is equally likely to be in the seen or unseen bucket.\n\nIn the\nabsence of temporal effects, this is reasonable for house prices.\n\nMore generally,\nsupervised learning requires a well-curated dataset that is closely aligned with the\nprediction task at hand.\n\nBut, as we will see, language models are trained on vast corpora\nof somewhat ruthlessly collected texts from the internet.\n\nYet, completing a random partial\nsentence from the internet is presumably not what businesses using language models\ncare about.\n\n**_Deep Learning as Automated Representation Learning_**\n\nAlthough useful for panel or tabular data, pre-deep-learning-era supervised algorithms struggled\nto predict well when presented with visual or auditory inputs.", "Although the promise of machine\nlearning is predicated on the automation of learning, in practice, supervised learning algorithms\nrequire carefully crafted representations of input data in which operations like additions and\nmultiplications, for example, for linear regression, were semantically relevant.\n\nDecades of\npainstaking research in signal processing and computer vision had resulted in domain-specific\nhand-crafted representations, each useful for a specific modality (images, audio, or video).\n\nThe\npredictive performance of ML algorithms was limited by how good such representations were.\n\nFigure 6: A typical _deep_ neural network for recognizing faces.\n\nEach\n\nsuccessive layer progressively learns higher-level representations (from\n\nedges to contours to faces).\n\n-----\n\nKaran Singh, Assistant Professor of Operations Research\n\nThe revolution in deep learning was to automate the process of representation learning itself.\n\nDeep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers, each layer incrementally converting\nthe data into a more manageable form, all to make better predictions.\n\nThis form of automated\nhierarchical representation learning heralded a decade of tremendous progress in image and\nspeech recognition and machine translation, starting with the breakthrough work of Krizhevsky,\nSutskever, and Hinton in 2012 on the Imagenet challenge.\n\nTaking advantage of GPUs (a form 8\n\nof shared-memory parallel computing) and the availability of a large public dataset, this seminal\nwork slashed the error rate for image recognition by a substantial multiple.\n\nParallel gains were\nlater realized using similar deep neural network architectures in speech recognition and other\nmachine learning domains.\n\nIn this sense, the advances deep learning enabled were (relatively)\ndomain agnostic.\n\nAlthough deep neural networks are data-hungry in that they require a substantially large dataset\nto start predicting well, they also successfully realize a long-promised advantage of neural\nnetworks.\n\nThis factor is crucial to the practice of modern-day machine learning.\n\nIn the process of\nhierarchically learning representations, deep nets learn task- (or label--) agnostic features of the\ndataset in the lower layers, while higher layers closer to the output account for task-specific\nrepresentations.\n\nThis permits us to (a) train a deep net to separate images of cats and dogs on\na large dataset and (b) subsequently build a shallow (even linear) performant neural net that\nuses the lower layers of the former to craft useful representations to classify images of zebra\nand giraffes.\n\nStep A is often called pre-training, and step B is referred to as supervised finetuning.\n\nThis manner of amortizing the learning across tasks that are not individually data-rich is\ncentral to language models.\n\n**_Word Embeddings and Contrastive Learning_**\n\nWhile the progress of deep learning in speech and audio was made possible by the availability\nof large crowd-labeled datasets (with 10s of millions of annotated images), such large highquality datasets were absent in the textual domain, despite a plethora of unlabelled data in the\nform of books, Wikipedia articles, and articles on the internet.\n\nCould a machine learning\nalgorithm make use of the cheap, unlabelled data instead?\n\nIn computational linguistics, the distributional hypothesis codifies an appealing and intuitive idea\nthat similar words occur in similar contexts.\n\nIn 2013, inspired by this observation, Mikolov et al 9\n\ntrained a neural network, termed Word2Vec, to predict randomly selected words in a text corpus\ngiven neighboring words for each.\n\nNote that this step doesn\u2019t require any need human\nannotators.\n\nThey observed that the 300-dimensional vector representations the neural net\nlearned for words had excellent linear algebraic properties that transparently reflected the\nunderlying semantics.\n\nFor example, one obtained Queen when queried for the word with the\nvector closest to King - Man + Woman.\n\nThus, each vector dimension captured some abstract\nsemantic degree of freedom.\n\nThese representations were also valuable for natural classification\ntasks with limited data, such as sentiment classification, given a small number of examples.\n\n-----\n\nKaran Singh, Assistant Professor of Operations Research\n\nFigure 7: Vector space representations of words exhibit linear algebraic\n\nrelationships between semantic units and can be used to answer analogy\n\nquestions, e.g., son - father + mother = daughter.\n\nThe approach of creating auxiliary labeling tasks for free from unlabelled data to learn\nsemantically relevant representation is called contrastive learning and has proved helpful in\nother domains, too.\n\nFor example, given a set of unlabelled images, a classifier trained to\nrecognize random crops from the same image as a positive match and those from distinct\nimages as a negative match (pre-training step) learns representations useful for supervised finetuning on genuine classification tasks downstream.", "**_Transformers mollify the Optimization Landscape_**\n\nWhile word embeddings serve as proof that textual semantic regularities can be assessed\nwithout labeled data, substantive language processing tasks need an algorithmic\nimplementation of the concept of memory to capture relationships between words that are\npositionally far apart.\n\nFor example, a common motif in stories is that the next act derives from\nsome event that occurred a while ago.\n\nFigure 8: RNNs capture memory effects by sequentially processing\n\ninformation.\n\n-----\n\nKaran Singh, Assistant Professor of Operations Research\n\nThe first generation of neural networks that captured the notion of memory were Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs), by sequentially processing a piece of text one word at a time while\nupdating an internal state to maintain continuity, a proxy for memory.\n\nUnfortunately, optimizing\nsuch recurrent neural nets to find one that best fits a given dataset proved extra-ordinarily errorprone and challenging.\n\nIn 2017, Vaswani et al introduced a different neural network architecture, termed transformer, 10\n\nthat could efficiently capture long-range relations between tokens compactly (non-sequentially)\nby processing the entire surrounding context window at once while remaining amenable to\ngradient-based optimization.\n\nThe introduction of transformers spurred a line of research on\nlanguage models, culminating in training models with an increasingly higher number of\nparameters trained on ever larger datasets.\n\nFor example, GPT2 (Generative Pre-trained\nTransformer 2), released in 2019, is a 1.5 billion parameter model trained on 40 GB of data,\nwhile GPT3, released in 2020, is a 175 billion parameter model trained on 570 GB of text data.\n\nWhile larger models resulted in better performance, the open-market cost for training these\nenormous models was estimated to be tens of millions of dollars.\n\nFigure 9: The LLM arms race with exponentially increasing\n\nparameter counts.\n\n(Credit: HuggingFace)\n\n**_General-Purpose Language Models: Supervised Fine-tuning & GPT3_**\n\nThe general paradigm brought about by contrastive learning was first to learn a large model on\nauxiliary tasks created using an unlabelled dataset (the pre-training step) and subsequently to\nuse these learned representations in a downstream supervised learning task given a few taskspecific labeled examples (the supervised fine-tuning step).\n\nWhile broadly useful and practical,\nsupervised fine-tuning requires replicas of the baseline pre-trained model for each downstream\n\n\n-----\n\nKaran Singh, Assistant Professor of Operations Research\n\ntask; further, the large size of language models makes running even a few steps of gradientbased iterative optimization for supervised learning prohibitive except on computationally\nexpensive hardware setups.\n\nThe paper describing the architecture of the GPT3 model presents a far cheaper and more 11\n\nconvenient way of repurposing pre-trained language models for specific downstream tasks,\nnamely, by specifying a few labeled examples in the prompt before asking for a label or\nresponse for unseen data.\n\nThis mode of inference, in-context learning, does not require\ncomputationally expensive adjustments to the weights or parameters of an LLM and instead\ntreats the entire downstream supervised task as a prompt for the language model to complete.\n\nThis makes LLMs very attractive for end-users, who no longer have to create copies of the large\nmodel to customize, nor do they have to run a sophisticated optimization procedure to adjust\nparameters; each downstream task, in effect, becomes a conversation.\n\nWhile fine-tuning may\nstill result in additional performance gains over in-context learning for some tasks in exchange\nfor a massive increase in computational load, a crucial advance of GPT3 is that this\nsubstantially lowers this gap, democratizing the use (although not the training) of LLMs.\n\nFigure 10: An illustration of in-context learning.\n\nGPT4 figures out the\n\ncorrect pattern that the answer is the first number + reverse of the\n\nsecond, given two examples.\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\nKaran Singh, Assistant Professor of Operations Research\n\n**_Towards Conversational genai: Learning from Human Feedback_**\n\nWhile GPT3-like models happen to be good at conversation-centered tasks, they are not\nexplicitly trained or incentivized to follow instructions.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s InstructGPT model post pre 12\ntraining aligns the model to follow the users\u2019 instructions by fine-tuning the model to mimic\nlabeled demonstrations of the desired behavior (via supervised learning) and highly-ranked\nresponses to prompts as collected using human feedback (via reinforcement learning).\n\nFigure 11: While GPT3 performs text completion by guessing the\n\nmost plausible completion, InstructGPT has been explicitly\ntrained to follow instructions.", "Figure 11: While GPT3 performs text completion by guessing the\n\nmost plausible completion, InstructGPT has been explicitly\ntrained to follow instructions.\n\n(Credit: OpenAI\u2019s web report)\n\n**_The Future: Foundation Models_**\n\nGiven the success of language models, there has been increased interest in the possibility of\nrecreating the magic of LLMs in other domains.\n\nSuch models, generically termed foundation\nmodels, attempt to amortize the cost of limited-data downstream tasks by pre-training on large\ncorpora of broadly related tasks or unlabelled datasets.\n\nFor example, one might be able to\nrepurpose the LLM paradigm to train a generalist robot or decision-making agent that learns\nfrom supply chain operations across all industries.", "**Conclusion**\n\nThis report contextualizes

**_or_**\n\n\n**_perspective of the authors; a \u201cghost_**\n**_written\u201d review article that is conceived_**\n**_by GenAI and then simply fact-checked_**\n**_or copy edited by the authors seems a_**\n**_distortion of that intent, and this_**\n**_possibility_** **_should_** **_be_** **_considered_**\n\n\ndatabases.\n\nIt is widely assumed that there are **_possibility_** **_should_** **_be_**\npockets of information in distinct fields that, if **_carefully by the authors to confirm that it_**\ncombined, could lead to breakthroughs.\n\nBut despite **_still expresses their own insights._**\nthe volume of published information, those\nserendipitous connections are infrequent because\nfields are mutually inaccessible due to technical\nlanguage, and no one from either field knows to look for the other (e.g., epidemiologists and aerosol\nphysicists).\n\nIn fact, interdisciplinary research often espouses the mixing of existing information in\nnew ways, implying that GenAI systems which can keep track of vastly more information than any\nperson may find connections that might be missed entirely by humans.\n\nActing as \u201cstate-of-the-art\ninformation retrieval\u201d systems (Extance, 2018), they go beyond conventional databases, such as\nGoogle Scholar and PubMed, by being able to retrieve, synthesize, visualize, and summarize\nmassive amounts of existing knowledge (e.g., Semantic Scholar, Scopus genai, Microsoft Academic,\nIris.genai, Scite, Consensus).\n\nAs such, they have the potential to help overcome the problem of\n\u201cundiscovered public knowledge\u201d (Swanson, 1986; Davies, 1989), which may exist within the\npublished literature, and break through disciplinary silos, facilitating the discovery of relevant\nresearch across diverse academic disciplines.\n\nIn this context, suggested practices for using GenAI in the literature review phase of research\nconception are that:\n\n\n**_carefully by the authors to confirm that it_**\n**_still expresses their own insights._**\n\n\n\n-  GenAI can be used to triage, organize, summarize, and quickly get directionally oriented,\n\n\nin the context of an exponentially growing base of reported claims and established\nknowledge.\n\n-  GenAI can be used to assist with drafting literature reviews, although researchers should\n\n\nfact-check and be aware of incomplete, biased, or even false GenAI outputs.\n\nIn some cases,\nit can help to provide GenAI with explicit prompt text to try to guard against the use of\nfake references (e.g., Dowling & Lucey, 2023), although it still does not guarantee accurate\nresults.\n\n-  Subject to authorship, citation, and fact-checking considerations, it can be helpful to use\n\n\nGenAI to ideate and iterate on the quality of a literature review.\n\nExamples include (a)\nrefining the review to include both prior research and its connection to the new research\n\n\n-----\n\nidea, (b) rewriting the style of the literature review, and (c) refining the literature review to\nemphasize the contribution of the new research, such as is relevant to other gaps in literature,\nuncertainties, or even market sentiments.\n\n_Duty of verification._ The reliability and quality of genai-powered literature review tools are limited by\nthe databases they search, which can affect the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the results.\n\nTherefore, it is advisable to use these tools in conjunction with other methods.\n\nAnother major concern\nwhen using these tools is plagiarism, as they can produce verbatim copies of existing work without\nproper attribution or introduce ideas and results from actual published work but provide incorrect\nor missing citations.\n\nTo minimize the risk of unintentional plagiarism, it is best to start with original\ntext and then use GenAI assistance to refine it, in line with the distinction between genai- _assisted_ and\ngenai- _written_ text (van Dis, Bollen, Zuidema et al., 2023).\n\nThis will help ensure that genai-generated text\nis original and reflects the authors\u2019 own work, as also emphasized in journals and professional\nsocieties that permit the use of GenAI tools (but note that some journals prohibit the use of GenAI\nfor any part of the research process entirely; see **Appendix 1** for a summary of existing community\npublication policies, noting that such policies are subject to change by those communities and\npublishers).", "Finally, depending on the extent of GenAI assistance with information search and\nliterature review production (specifically, when it is used beyond grammatical polishing of authorwritten text), researchers may have a _duty of disclosure_ for this research stage.", "**GenAI for Research Infrastructure**\n\nOne of the more benign possible uses of genai is in improving workflows and research processes.\n\nCollecting and processing data often involve custom software, using complicated APIs (application\nprogramming interface, or software with a specific function) that may be poorly documented.\n\nCode\ngeneration tools such as Copilot have become powerful and successful, leading to significant\nimprovements in users' ability to create software to collate and analyze data.\n\nOther ways might\ninvolve using GenAI to help construct or critique survey questions or interview templates.\n\nIn each\ncase, the genai is not involved in producing or recording data, but in building the infrastructure that is\nitself used to produce data.\n\nA second category of infrastructure might include code or language generation for presentation of\nresearch results.\n\nAPIs for generating figures, such as matplotlib or ggplot2, are notoriously\ncomplicated, with innumerable options for modifying the appearance and layout of graphics.\n\nCode\ngeneration may help in producing programs to generate graphics from data sets, without being\ndirectly involved in the construction of data sets themselves.\n\nSimilarly, language models might assist\nin generating alt-text for image accessibility.\n\n_Duty of verification._ As with any other use of GenAI, infrastructure-building uses require careful\nchecking to ensure that outputs are correct.\n\nThere should be clear responsibility for who will do this\nverification.\n\nWe see less need to disclose the use of GenAI in these \"back office\" contexts relative\nto other uses, though still with care for potential implications at later research stages.", "**GenAI for Data Collection and Generation**\n\nA subtle but important distinction is when we move from using _GenAI to help develop tools that we_\n_use in research_ to using _GenAI as a tool for research_ , specifically for data collection and generation.\n\nIn principle, the potential for data collection is enormous.\n\nGenAI can be used to help construct data\n\n\n-----\n\nsets from unstructured data, such as descriptions of patents, job vacancies, SEC (US Security and\nExchange Commission) filings, banker speeches, etc.\n\nGenAI tools can also be used to synthesize\ninformation coming from text, or images.\n\nThey can be employed to self-assess (predict accuracy)\nand augment which coding tasks are conducted by human iteration.\n\nAdvantages for data collection\nand generation using GenAI as a tool for research include:\n\n\n\n-  Collecting and organizing data.\n\nConsider the Cornell Lab of Ornithology\u2019s example of eBird\n\n\nas one data-rich source: Through this global application platform, birdwatchers have\nsubmitted a large amount of bird observations that have already informed development of\nspecies distribution models (Sullivan et al., 2014).\n\n-  Generating data out of unstructured information.\n\n-  Summarizing data coming from various sources.\n\nData related to human clinical trials or\n\n\npatient outcomes hold different and important data privacy concerns, but the collection and\norganization/cleaning of such data is a key step in inference for patient-centered health\noutcomes (Waitman et al., 2023).\n\n-  Scaling up data collection with GenAI by conducting faster and less resource-intensive\n\n\nexperiments.\n\nThe challenges of using GenAI tools for data collection and generation primarily relate to the _duties_\n_of verification and disclosure:_\n\n\n\u25aa Issues with performance and accuracy: Large language models like ChatGPT are currently\n\n\nnot fundamentally trained to speak accurately or stay faithful to some ground truth.\n\n\u25aa The reliance on large amounts of data may be challenging, and the needed data may not\n\n\nalways be available.\n\n\u25aa Bias (King and Zenil, 2023): genai is traditionally trained on data that has been processed by\n\n\nhumans.\n\nExample: In using ML to categorize different types of astronomical images, humans\nmight need to feed the system with a series of images they have already categorized and\nlabeled.\n\nThis would allow the system to learn the differences between the images.\n\nHowever,\nthose doing the labeling might have different levels of competence, make mistakes and so\non.\n\nGenAI could be used to detect and to some extent redress such biases.\n\n\u25aa Attribution: Data sources may not always be tracked.\n\nThere is a need for ensuring correct\n\n\nhumans.\n\nExample: In using ML to categorize different types of astronomical images, humans\nmight need to feed the system with a series of images they have already categorized and\nlabeled.\n\nThis would allow the system to learn the differences between the images.\n\nHowever,\nthose doing the labeling might have different levels of competence, make mistakes and so\non.\n\nGenAI could be used to detect and to some extent redress such biases.\n\nattribution of data sources.\n\nGiven these challenges, the use of GenAI tools for data generation and collection must be carefully\ndocumented and disclosed to facilitate research assessment, transparency, and reproducibility.", "**GenAI for Ideation & Hypothesis Generation**\n\nWhile the use of GenAI for idea generation is under early consideration by most academic\nresearchers, it is important to weigh its strengths and weaknesses in the early phases of research.\n\nIf\nwe think of the idea generation process as a creative process (as opposed to fact-checking or\nverification), then complementing ideation with GenAI can potentially offset human weaknesses,\nsuch as comparatively poorer memory recall versus recognition processes and narrower breadth of\nknowledge bases.\n\nIn this sense, GenAI can complement individual researchers during the ideageneration process and democratize access to research assistants.\n\nOn the other hand, scientific\nknowledge relies on the ability to reason rationally, do abstract modeling and make logical\ninferences.\n\nHowever, these abilities are handled poorly by statistical machine learning (ML).\n\nHumans\ndo not need a large amount of data or observations to generate a hypothesis, while statistical ML\n\n\n-----\n\nrelies on vast amounts of data.\n\nAs a consequence, computers are still unable to formulate impactful\nresearch questions, design proper experiments, and understand and describe their limitations.\n\nFurthermore, assessing the scientific value of a hypothesis requires in-depth, domain-specific, and\nsubject-matter expertise.\n\nAn example is the potential of \u201cLanguage Based Discovery\u201d (LBD) as the\npossibility to create entirely new, plausible and scientifically non-trivial hypotheses by combining\nfindings or assertions across multiple documents.\n\nIf one article asserts that \u201cA affects B\u201d and another\nthat \u201cB affects C,\u201d then \u201cA affects C\u201d is a natural hypothesis.\n\nThe challenge is for LBD to identify\nwhich assertions of the type \u201cA affects C\u201d are novel, scientifically plausible, non-trivial and\nsufficiently interesting that a scientist would find them worthy of study (Smalheiser et al.\n\n2023).\n\nWhereas GenAI does well in identifying and retrieving potential data constructs, researcher domain\nexpertise remains critical for determining the quality of output (Dowling and Lucey, 2023).\n\nWhile considering the possibilities of GenAI-human collaboration for research ideation, it is essential\nto emphasize _the duty of discretion_ to prevent the leakage of proprietary, sensitive, and confidential\ninformation into public information space.\n\nFurthermore, since using GenAI tools is an evolving space,\nacademics should learn more about GenAI technologies and stay abreast of potentially useful ways\nfor hypothesis generation.\n\nFor example, as food for thought, one of the GenAI prompts used by\nDowling and Lucey (2023) for idea generation: \"You [the GenAI tool] created this research idea,\nand I\u2019d like you to improve it.\n\nCould you see if there is an additional article that can be added, to\nimprove the research idea.\n\nCan you also talk about the novel contribution of the idea.\n\nPlease keep\nit to about 100 words.\u201d Moreover, as we humans gain experience and familiarity with new tools,\nwe do well to be observant to the expectation that they can also change how we conduct research\nand interact with researchers at this ideation and hypothesis generation stage \u2013 in ways that are\nnot always easy to identify _a priori_ .\n\nFinally, we note that research execution includes expectations of responsible conduct of research,\nwhich for some studies and disciplines includes prior approval of data use and management, animal\nwelfare and procedures, and human subjects.\n\nUse of GenAI in research will likely augment\nconsiderations of these approvals per expectations of sponsors or federal agencies through\nresearch integrity review processes of the university.\n\nThose considerations related to research\ncompliance are expanded in Section D. Next, we consider the stage where research of any type is\ndisseminated through public disclosure including peer-reviewed publications.", "## B.\n\nResearch Dissemination Stage\n\nGenAI offers new affordances that support both positive and negative outcomes for research\ndissemination (Nordling, 2003).\n\nOn the positive side there is the potential to level the playing field\nfor non-native speakers of English; to provide writing assistance resulting in improved clarity; and\nfor new tools that aid in more equitable discovery of related work (improving on common practices\nof searching for well-known authors, for example).\n\nOn the negative side there are serious and\nreasonable concerns such as erroneous information being disseminated because of inadequate\nverification; easier plagiarism (either intentional or accidental); lack of appropriate attribution\nbecause current LLM-based tools are unable to indicate the source of information; bias and\nideological influence; and inappropriate use of GenAI as a lazy peer review tool.\n\nAdditionally, we\nmust be aware that careless use of GenAI may entrench biases in scholarly communication and\ndissemination, such as reinforcing the positions of prominent scholars and preferring sources in\nEnglish as the dominant language of the initial trained models available to the general public.\n\nHowever, future GenAI tools may also provide new interventions to oppose existing biases that are\nentrenched in current practice.\n\nAs such, the following is less focused on specific GenAI tools available\n\n\n-----\n\ntoday, but more on general recommendations for the responsible use of GenAI tools in research\ndissemination that upholds research integrity as a principal value at Cornell.\n\nIn this section and research stage, we do not discuss questions of copyright, confidentiality or\nintellectual property (see Section C), but instead focus on the conceptual impact that GenAI can\nhave on producing research output.\n\nFollowing from the definition of GenAI from above, a key\ndistinction is whether the tool **produces output for dissemination that contains concepts and**\n**interpretations that the author did not supply** .\n\nFrom this perspective, GenAI tools that fill in\nconcepts or interpretations for the authors can fundamentally change the research methodology,\nthey can provide authors with \u201cshortcuts\u201d that lead to a breakdown of rigor, and they can introduce\nbias.\n\nThis makes it imperative that users of GenAI tools are well aware of the limitations of these\ntools, and that it is clear who is responsible for the integrity of the research and the output that is\nproduced.\n\nBelow we discuss these issues in more detail and provide a minimal set of norms that we recommend\nacross all disciplines.\n\nHowever, we recognize that the methodology and standards are differentially\nimpacted by GenAI across disciplines (e.g., humanities as well as engineering), and that community\nnorms around the use of GenAI may be stricter than what is outlined below.\n\n**Authorship** : We posit that GenAI tools do not deserve author credit and cannot take on author\nresponsibility.\n\nThis means that authors of research outputs, not any GenAI tools used in the process,\ncarry the responsibility for checking the correctness of any statements.\n\nAuthors must be aware that\nGenAI tools can and do produce erroneous results including \u201challucinated\u201d citations.\n\nThe content will\nbe viewed as statements made by the authors.\n\nIndeed, there are emerging concerns on impact to\nscientific publishing with which publishers and genai ethicists are now grappling (Conroy 2023), but the\nresponsibility of authentic authorship is a component of research integrity that will continue to rest\nwith the human authors.\n\n**Impact on Concepts and Interpretations** : Researchers need to be aware that GenAI tools can have\na substantial impact on the research output depending on how they are used to fill in concepts and\nadd interpretations.\n\nIf the impact is substantial, we recommend that the use of GenAI is disclosed\nand detailed so that readers are aware of its potential impact.\n\nWhat constitutes substantial impact\ndepends on the type of publication (e.g., journal articles, books, talks, reports, reviews, research\nproposals) and community norms in the respective discipline.\n\nAn example that is probably\nconsidered to have a substantial impact in any discipline is the use of GenAI to draft a related work\nsection.\n\n**Impact on Methodology** : Writing and other dissemination activities typically cannot be separated\nfrom conducting the research, and the act of writing is explicitly part of the research methodology\nin some disciplines.\n\nA key concern is that the use of GenAI as a \u201cshortcut\u201d can lead to a degradation\nof methodological rigor.\n\nIf the use of GenAI tools can be viewed as part of the research\nmethodology, then we recommend disclosure so that readers can assess the rigor of the\nmethodology.\n\nIndeed, there may be collective impact on methodology at the scale of the research\ncommunity\u2019s practices.", "Indeed, there may be collective impact on methodology at the scale of the research\ncommunity\u2019s practices.\n\nWhether GenAI becomes a tool that sharpens our minds or a blunt instrument\nthat dulls them is a question that Cornell (and other communities of research scholars) must address\nactively over time.\n\nHistorically, human imagination sees most tools as helpful implements to move on\nto harder problems and more creative discovery and analysis, if one masters the tool instead of\nthe other way around.\n\nBut we can also recognize from past experiences that zeal for rapid\ndevelopment of exciting new research-enabling capabilities \u2013 especially when these provide\n\n\n-----\n\ncompetitive advantage over peers that can relate to economic competition or even national security\n\u2013 can shift even the best intentioned individuals to start to behave collectively as a group that\nfocuses sharply on the benefits without openly discussing the costs and trade-offs.\n\n**Potential for Bias** : Just as authors need to be aware of human biases in their sources, authors using\nGenAI tools need to be aware that these tools have biases and may reflect specific ideologies.\n\nIt\nis the authors\u2019 responsibility to counteract or avoid these biases, and authors cannot offload\nresponsibility for bias in their work on the genai system.\n\nFor example, use of a GenAI tool to create a\nhospital scene might result in an image in which the nurses are female and the doctors are male.\n\nChanging the prompt could address this bias.\n\nAnother issue is that GenAI tools may reflect a\nparticular ideology, or they may perpetuate historical biases because GenAI tools are trained on\nhistorical data.\n\nThis may be compounded by particular algorithms such as citation analysis which\nhas an inherent time lag, and might further bias recommendations back in time or towards a\ndominant group or language.\n\n**Acceptable Use** : There are many different forms and venues of research dissemination: journal\narticles, books, talks, reports, reviews, research proposals, etc.\n\nWhat is acceptable use of GenAI in\none form of communication is not necessarily acceptable in other forms, and authors must adhere to\ncommunity standards.\n\nTo take an extreme example, having a GenAI tool draft a peer review from\nscratch runs counter to the idea of peer review and has an extremely high impact on the review,\neven if the author checks and edits the review.\n\nThis is likely unacceptable in most communities.\n\nEven\nwithin communities, different publication venues (e.g., journal, conference) may have different\npolicies, and authors must check and follow these if more stringent than what is outlined here.\n\n**genai Literacy to support Research Integrity** : Rigorous and ambitious use of GenAI tools requires a\ngood understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these tools.\n\nFurthermore, as GenAI has\nbecome part of the integrity of research and its dissemination, then research leaders such as\nprincipal investigators and faculty supervising student research should now make the appropriate\nuse of GenAI part of their mentoring.\n\nIn particular, part of their mentoring is to communicate the\nstandards and the norms in their specific fields to the researchers and students they lead \u2013 just as\nthey mentor on other topics of research conduct (e.g., plagiarism, co-authorship, privacy\nregulations).\n\n**Regulations** : Any use of GenAI tools needs to be compliant with regulations (e.g., copyright law,\nprivacy regulations such as HIPAA and FERPA, confidentiality agreements, and intellectual\nproperty).\n\nIn particular, users must be aware that use of GenAI tools may disclose sensitive\ninformation to a third party, which may be in violation of regulations and confidentiality norms\n(Lauer et al.\n\n2023; Conroy 2023).\n\nThis extension to implications for subsequent research translation\nto policies, processes, and products of all types is discussed further in Section C.", "## C. Research Translation Stage\n\nThe use of GenAI in any stage of the research process may impact the translation, protection and\nlicensing of intellectual property (IP), commercialization of technology, open-source release of\nsoftware and other uses of the research output downstream.\n\nInterpretations of laws and new\nregulations regarding GenAI are major topics for governments in many countries including the US.\n\nThere may be new government agencies and international organizations created for genai regulation\nand coordination in the near future.\n\nIn fact, while the European Union recently announced new\nregulations on genai, current understanding is that most of this EU policy effort to\ncreate these \u201cfirst rules\u201d preceded widespread use of GenAI (European Union Commission 2023).\n\n-----\n\nWe can draw no immediate conclusions on how the EU\u2019s risk-based approach may impact GenAI\ndevelopment and uses specifically.\n\nThe nature of the impact of GenAI is still evolving and may\nchange in coming years, with legislation and guidelines expected to lag the use of GenAI and its\nshorter term implications, which may be inadequately addressed under current laws and\nregulations.\n\nThe following are important areas for researchers to consider for translation when they\nuse GenAI in their research process:\n\n**Inventorship and Patentability:** Recent US case law has held that inventors of patents must be\nhuman beings under the US Patent Act.\n\nDocumentation of human contribution and disclosure of the\nnature of GenAI utilization are essential for patent eligibility.\n\nKey information needs to be carefully\ndocumented, such as:\n\n-  Specific GenAI tools used and rationale for their use;\n\n-  Detailed input into and output of the GenAI tool;\n\n-  Whether the outputs lead to any aspects of the conception of the invention;\n\n-  Contributions of individual inventors in the inventive idea, and how they directed and\n\n\nrefined the GenAI output; and\n\n-  For research done in teams, delineate the role of GenAI for each inventor.\n\n**Copyright and Authorship** : Under current US copyright law, copyright can protect only material\nthat is the product of human creativity and authors of copyrighted materials must be human beings.\n\nWhen incorporating GenAI-generated content, the authors should:\n\n\n\n-  Clearly document the boundary between human-created and GenAI-created content\n\n\nwith clear annotations.\n\n-  According to guidance published by US Copyright Office, if copyright registration is\n\n\nsought, the nature and extent of the use of GenAI, if containing more than AIgenerated material, must be disclosed with clarifications of what part of the work was _de minimis_\ncreated by the researchers and what part of the work was created by the GenAI.\n\n-  Specifically for computational algorithms and code, where research code can be further\n\n\ntranslated to wider use through copyright and various licensing types including opensource licensing, considerations attach at a time of active discussion.\n\nWe note emerging\nconsiderations of copyright infringement, not only for creative works such as songs but\nalso for computational code.\n\nFor example, it is possible that code generated by a LLM\nreflects code reproduced verbatim from the LLM training set unbeknownst to the user.\n\nWhen such code is part of a research outcome that may be made available to licensees\n(even open-source licensees), it is possible but not yet well understood how use of such\ncode, even when unintentionally plagiarized from other original sources, may violate\ncopyright or invalidate licenses.\n\n**Commercialization and Fair Use** : For research that leads to commercialization and publications\nwith financial benefits, to mitigate risks of potential infringement claims, the inventors and authors\nshould:\n\n\n\n-  Prioritize the use of GenAI tools that are trained using only public domain works, which\n\n\nis a small but growing area of development.\n\nFor example, the recently announced genai\nAlliance coalition that includes Cornell as a founding member and anchored by two forprofit companies, IBM and Meta, advocates for development of open-source software\ntools including those enabling GenAI (  ; Lin, B., 2023).\n\n-----\n\n-  Understand that the commercial intent can significantly impact fair use considerations.\n\nConsult with relevant university offices, such as the Center for Technology Licensing or\nGeneral Counsel\u2019s office, when there are questions.\n\n-  Stay informed of ongoing litigation that may influence the use of copyrighted materials\n\n\nin GenAI training data set.\n\nThere are pending class action copyright suits by authors\nagainst entities owning GenAI tools for training without compensation to the authors.\n\n**Data Privacy and Protection** : For data that researchers enter into GenAI themselves, it is important\nthat researchers follow Cornell Policy 4.21 on Research Data Retention.\n\nNote that this is an existing\npolicy and practice, simply extended to GenAI.", "Note that this is an existing\npolicy and practice, simply extended to GenAI.\n\nPrivate, confidential, or proprietary data owned\nor controlled by Cornell may have certain contractual or legal restrictions or limitations, such as\nthose to sponsors or collaborators, that would preclude their use in GenAI research projects, and it\nis a researcher\u2019s responsibility to verify/determine whether any such data sets have restrictions on\nsuch use before inputting them into public-facing GenAI and ensuring compliance with any\nrestrictions mandated by contract, law, or governing body (e.g., IRB, IAUCC).\n\nAny use of patient or\nhuman derived data should be disclosed to such governing body during the approval process and\nany such data set should only be used in research projects upon the explicit approval of the relevant\ngoverning body on campus.\n\n**Training** : Specific to this stage of research translation, it is recommended that the university provide\nongoing workshops on campus or through online platforms, and offer training materials through\nwebsites and other distribution channels, on topics related to the use of GenAI and its impact on\npatent rights, copyrighted materials, commercialization, open-source release and other uses to aid\nthe researchers in understanding their rights, obligations, best practices and landscapes of relevant\nlaws and regulations.\n\nIndeed, Cornell includes faculty and staff experts that can facilitate and codevelop such resources as part of their scholarly practice.", "**HUMAN

research_**\nthat are available to provide support.\n\nWhen **_with_** **_unique_** **_data_** **_protection_** **_and_**\nappropriate, this outreach should be shared **_ethical/societal considerations, which_**\nby central offices and posted to central web **_will continue to meet federal and review_**\n\n**_body guidelines._**\n\npages \u2013 such as the recently developed\ngenai website hosted by\nCornell Information Technology (CIT) that links\nto Cornell\u2019s GenAI in Education report and\nother resources \u2013 rather than from individual units or departments, to create consistent\nunderstanding and information access across campus.\n\nProviding this type of outreach from\ncentral offices can help ensure that the university as a whole is looking to the same resources;\nthat inquiries and concerns come to the appropriate offices; that approaches, advice, and\nguidance given are consistent across units; and that gaps in accessibility of information and\nlearning are kept to a minimum.\n\n**_ethical/societal considerations, which_**\n**_will continue to meet federal and review_**\n**_body guidelines._**\n\n\nAs with training on the use of, for example, animals, human participants, or biological agents\n\n\nin research, centralized training should be provided on the use of GenAI.\n\nThis training should\nnot only focus on risks and concerns, but on how to get the most out of these types of tools, and\nhow to use them better.\n\n\u201cHackathons as Training\u201d should make it enjoyable for researchers to\ngain new skills, while also contributing to the safe and responsible use of GenAI.\n\n-  Guidance on navigating mistakes made and security breaches should be communicated\n\n\nuniversity-wide.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that with these new tools comes some anxiety\nabout making mistakes in using them appropriately or even safely.\n\nTo an extent, inadvertent\n\n\n-----\n\nmistakes present opportunities for education and training.\n\nHowever, it is also important that any\nmistakes that lead to security, privacy, or other concerns are handled correctly and in a timely\nmanner.\n\nInformation should be shared university-wide about Cornell\u2019s expectations and\nprocesses with regard to what to do in the case of a potential security or other risk related to\nthe use of GenAI, and which responsible offices should be notified.\n\n-  Additional tools and resources should be developed to provide guidance.\n\nIt would be beneficial\n\n\nto researchers and administrative staff alike to develop a GenAI-enabled tool (e.g., a form of\na chatbot) that would respond to common inquiries about the use of GenAI in research.\n\nFor\nexample, \u201cCan I use GenAI to edit my scope of work?\u201d This tool could be populated with\nresponses to common questions, so that consistent answers could be communicated broadly \u2013\neven while appreciating that perspectives and cultural norms and even sponsor requirements\nand expectations may be changing fluidly in the coming years.\n\nBecause such a tool would be\nautomated and would provide immediate access to answers to these types of common questions,\nit would both reduce wait times and delays associated with other means of gathering this\ninformation, and reduce administrative workload in responding to these types of common\nrequests.", "Similarly, resources that facilitate awareness of resource use (e.g., estimated carbon\ndioxide emissions associated with tool use; see Section A) can be made available at the Artificial\nIntelligence website and/or developed by Cornellians whose research and translation focus\nincludes sustainability practices (e.g., Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability).", "## Perspectives and Cultural Norms\n\nHaving framed the use of GenAI in research across the stages of research above, we here\nsummarize the perspectives that can inform our cultural norms.\n\nThe widespread availability of GenAI\ntools offers new opportunities of creativity and efficiency, and as with any new tool depends on\nhumans for responsible and ethical deployment in research and society.\n\nThus, it is important that\nCornell anticipates that researchers can and should use such tools appropriately, facilitates\nresearcher access to appropriate GenAI tools and to resources to improve researchers\u2019 \u201cgenai literacy.\u201d\nIt is also important that we develop shared understanding of the limits of appropriate use of specific\npublicly available and commercial GenAI tools, as well as the tradeoffs or risks involved in their\nuse.\n\nWhile these perspectives and cultural norms will vary reasonably among different research\ncommunities, and likely vary over time in the coming years, we offer the following summary\nconsiderations.\n\nThese are considerations of both opportunity (ambitious use that may create new\nknowledge, insights, and impact for the world) and accountability or responsibility (duty grounded\nin research integrity of individuals, research teams, and institutions including Cornell).\n\nWe consider\nthese to be peer-to-peer guidelines, not a suggestion of any formalized university policy.\n\nHowever,\nwe remind our fellow Cornellians that two existing policies naturally extend to use of GenAI tools\nin research:\n\n\n1.\n\nAs noted in the University Privacy Statement , Cornell strives to honor the Privacy Principles : Notice, Choice,\n\n\nAccountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse.\n\nThis is noted on Cornell\u2019s genai website, along with preliminary guidelines of accountability that\nare discussed in this report in the context of researcher duties and research integrity.\n\n2.\n\nCornell Policy 4.21 on Research Data Retention .\n\nPrivate, confidential, or proprietary data owned or controlled\n\n\nby Cornell _may_ have certain contractual or legal restrictions or limitations, such as those to sponsors or\ncollaborators, that would preclude their use in GenAI research projects.\n\nIt is the researcher\u2019s responsibility to\nverify/determine whether any such data sets have restrictions on such use before inputting them into publicfacing GenAI and ensuring governing body compliance (e.g., IRB, IAUCC).\n\nRelatedly, any use of patient or\nhuman derived data should be disclosed to such governing body during the approval process, and any such\n\n\n-----\n\ndata set should only be used in research projects upon the explicit approval of the relevant governing body\non campus.", "#### Considerations for the Cornell Research Community\n\nWe as colleagues encourage faculty, research and administrative staff, and students to help\ndevelop the norms, technology, and public reflection on GenAI use in research, to both shape and\nstay current on these uses and scholarly practices.\n\nThese five areas of consideration for the Cornell\nresearch community are summarized below, as part of responsible experimentation.\n\nHELP DEVELOP THE NORMS, TECHNOLOGY, and PUBLIC LITERACY around GenAI.\n\n\uf06f Actively develop the norms and best practices around the use of GenAI in their disciplines.\n\n\uf06f Develop GenAI technology that is particularly suited for research (e.g., improved\n\n\nattribution).\n\nGenAI development for academic use should not be left solely to for-profit\ncompanies.\n\n\uf06f Engage in GenAI public literacy efforts to foster responsible and ethical use of GenAI tools.\n\nUsing at least one of these tools is enormously helpful to being part of that conversation and\nprocess, and many are freely and publicly available with associated caveats on risks of\nuse.\n\n**Table 1** provides examples of currently available GenAI tools that can be accessed\n(denoted as \u201cfree\u201d to indicate no financial charge to the user).\n\nWe emphasize user\nawareness and appropriate caution: only publicly available data should be included, and\nthe user should assume that any entry of information by the user can be absorbed into that\ntool\u2019s training set and potentially exposed to others.\n\nSTAY UP-TO-DATE with GenAI Uses and Practices\n\n\n\uf06f Each research subcommunity (whether a faculty member\u2019s research group, a department,\n\n\ninterdisciplinary research center or institute, or college/school as those researchers see fit)\ngather relevant information on relevant policies by professional associations, journals and\nfunding institutions to stay up-to-date with evolving policies, practices, and requirements in\nyour field **.\n\nAppendix 0** may serve as a discussion starter.\n\n\uf06f Train in how to use GenAI tools in a safe, effective, and productive manner in research and\n\n\ninnovation.\n\nDevelop expertise in the potential limitations and risks of GenAI tools.\n\n-----\n\n|Free* GenAI Tool|How to find it|What it can do|\n|---|---|---|\n|ChatGPT|Go to

December 2023, where *free indicates no financial fee charged to_\n\n\n_the user.\n\nNone of these tools are endorsed by Cornell, and those using these tools should note that these tools_\n\n\n_are_ **_only for use with public data._**\n\n\nFurther, when acting as well-informed academic researchers with access to this research tool among\nothers, consider the individual and shared **_duties of verification, disclosure, and discretion_** across the\nstages of research ideation and execution, public disclosure, translation, and funding expectations:\n\nDuty OF VERIFICATION\n\n\n\uf06f DO verify the accuracy and validity of GenAI outputs.\n\nThe responsibility for research\n\n\naccuracy remains with researchers.\n\n\uf06f DO check for unintentional plagiarism.\n\nGenAI can produce verbatim copies of existing work,\n\n\nor more subtly, introduce ideas and results from other sources but provide incorrect or\nmissing citations.\n\nDuty OF DISCLOSURE\n\n\n\uf06f DO keep documentation and provide disclosure of GenAI use in all aspects of a research\n\n\nprocess, in accordance with the principles of research reproducibility, research\ntransparency, authorship and inventorship.\n\nDuty of DISCRETION\n\n\nX DO NOT assume that GenAI is private.\n\nGenAI systems run on training examples, and user\n\ninput and behavior are a prime source.\n\nEven if organizations that provide GenAI tools do\nnot currently claim to use data in this way, there is no guarantee that they may not in the\nfuture.\n\nX DO NOT share confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and export-controlled information with\n\npublicly available GenAI tools.\n\nX DO NOT assume that GenAI output is already considered part of the public domain (e.g.,\n\nnot legally encumbered by copyright).", "X DO NOT assume that GenAI output is already considered part of the public domain (e.g.,\n\nnot legally encumbered by copyright).\n\nGenAI tools can \"memorize\" their training data and\n\n\n-----\n\nrepeat it with a level of verbatim accuracy that violates copyright.\n\nEven material that is not\ncopyrighted may produce liability for corporate partners in sponsored research, if it is\nderived from data generated by a competitor.", "#### Considerations for Cornell Leadership\n\nWe also provide considerations for Cornell leadership, particularly for aspects of GenAI\npreparedness and facilitated use in research and innovation that can be implemented collectively\nacross Cornell\u2019s colleges, schools, and campuses.\n\n-  Develop a knowledge base module, perhaps as part of responsible research conduct\n\n\ntraining resources, for rigorous, ethical and responsible use of GenAI in research and related\nactivities.\n\nUsers of GenAI tools need to understand their strengths and weaknesses, as well\nas regulations around privacy, special data considerations such as personally identifiable,\nhuman subject, or proprietary commercial data, and confidentiality and commercialization.\n\n-  Consider procurement of Cornell-licensed GenAI tools with data and privacy protection as\n\n\nfacilities for research, as well as for administrative and teaching uses.\n\nText generation and\nchat, program code generation, streamlined processes, and image generation would likely\nall be of value.\n\n-  Consider development or co-development of GenAI tools that are particularly suited for\n\n\nacademic research use cases, including use cases in research administration services.\n\n-  Identify relevant central offices responsible for providing university-wide communications,\n\n\nguidance, outreach, and training to all GenAI users on various aspects of uses.\n\nTo the extent\nthat it is possible and relevant, information on the use of GenAI should be shared from\ncentral locations to encourage consistent access and understanding across the university, and\nto avoid siloed, inconsistent, or incorrect information.\n\n-  In support of Cornell's public engagement mission, recognize Cornell efforts that improve\n\n\nGenAI public literacy beyond the university-affiliated community.\n\n-  Consider periodic updates to Cornell guidance, through a task force or other appropriate\n\n\nGenAI public literacy beyond the university-affiliated community.\n\nmechanisms, given the rapidly changing landscape of genai tools, uses, and\nconsiderations in academic research and translation of research outcomes.\n\n-----", "## A.\n\nResearch Ideation and Execution Stage\n\n**_When using a tool such as ChatGPT to generate research ideas for a research project sponsored by NSF,_**\n**_how do the researcher and principal investigator decide on which information and ideas to enter and_**\n**_\u201cshare\u201d with ChatGPT?_**\n\nAny information entered into public versions of ChatGPT involves sending that data to a third-party\nthat is under limited confidentiality and privacy restrictions (if any) with end users and not party to\nagreements with the NSF via data entry by other users, and the information that is entered can\neventually become public.\n\nAs such, where the use of ChatGPT for research idea generation does\nnot currently violate any known general NSF policies, users should also be sure not to violate any\nother agreements that may exist relative to their funding sponsorship agreements, such as\nconfidentiality, intellectual property, and entity identification clauses (e.g., mentioning NSF in any\ninput data may be discouraged to the extent that it is in conflict with an agreement).\n\n**_When using a tool such as ChatGPT to brainstorm solutions for research sponsored by a company (e.g.,_**\n**_Samsung, Boeing, Johnson and Johnson, Google), how do the researcher and principal investigator_**\n**_decide what information about the project can be entered and shared?_**\n\nAgain, any information entered into public versions of ChatGPT involves sending that data to a\nthird-party that is under limited confidentiality and privacy restrictions (if any) with end users and\nnot party to agreements with corporate sponsors via data entry by other users.\n\nFurthermore, any\ninformation that is entered can eventually become public.\n\nAs such, where the use of ChatGPT for\nbrainstorming solutions does not currently violate any known general policies, users should also be\nsure not to violate any other agreements that may exist relative to their funding sponsorship\nagreements, especially including but not limited to, confidentiality and intellectual property clauses.\n\n-----\n\n**_When using genai tools to summarize the literature for the introduction or discussion of a peerreviewed article, how should the researcher and corresponding author attribute or disclose this section_**\n**_of a manuscript or thesis?_**\n\nIn general, authors and/or principal investigators have ultimate responsibility for works (including\ntheir accuracy), and furthermore, summaries should not violate plagiarism rules and regulations.\n\nCitation style guides and support websites (e.g., for APA, Chicago, Harvard) are being updated to\nreflect proper citations for verbatim output from genai and other uses.\n\nAs a general\npractice, authors should be transparent and fully disclose uses of genai technologies,\nconsistent with publication outlet, department, or area policies.\n\n**_What are the conditions, if any, that a researcher should not use GenAI to generate research ideas?_**\n**_Examples may vary among research fields, sources of information included in a prompt including FERPA_**\n**_or HIPAA data, and collaborating or sponsoring organizations._**\n\nThere are no general rules that prohibit the user of genai to generate research ideas.\n\nHowever, because inputs into public genai platforms are not confidential and data can also\nbecome public, sensitive information and individual data should never be entered for any phase of\na research project, pursuant to personal data identification, re-identification, and/or chain of\ncustody FERPA and HIPAA requirements.\n\n**_In the process of research publication development, can tools such as Bard or ChatGPT be used: To_**\n**_summarize responses to online surveys of income level of state residents?\n\nTo summarize preclinical_**\n**_research animal model histology?\n\nTo summarize patients\u2019 blood oxygen levels in a registered NIH study?_**\n**_How can the differences among these use cases be distinguished in the responsible conduct of research?_**\n\nThe summary of online survey data and/or other data sets can be assisted by Bard or ChatGPT to\nthe extent that the researcher 1) does not enter confidential or data protected by other laws (e.g.,\nHIPAA), 2) does not violate a broader agreement (e.g., between researcher, institution, host, and/or\nfunder), and 3) has responsibility for the accuracy of the summary.", "## B.\n\nResearch Dissemination Stage\n\n**_When a figure for a publication or presentation or patent disclosure is generated by genai tools (e.g.,_**\n**_Midjourney; DeepAI), how should the principal investigator (who is typically the corresponding author_**\n**_or communicating inventor) verify the accuracy and intellectual ownership over the data or content of_**\n**_that image?_**\n\nWe see a distinction between cases where the author supplies all semantics and uses a tool for\nlayout and rendering, and when a tool is used to introduce semantics such as organization of ideas\nor the generation of structure.\n\nWhere the author supplies all semantics the use is akin to PowerPoint\nstyle suggestions or an automated layout tool, and acknowledgement is generally unnecessary\nunless publication policies require it.\n\nHowever, when GenAI introduces new semantics then we advise\nacknowledging its use, and checking the output carefully for accuracy.\n\nNorms around intellectual\nownership are in flux at this time, and we caution authors that this poses a substantial risk.\n\n**_Can images used in publications and theses be created wholly by genai?\n\nHow does this_**\n**_expectation change if the GenAI-drafted images are edited by the authors?\n\nHow does that vary among_**\n**_research disciplines?_**\n\n\n-----\n\nUses include generation of a cover image for a book or presentation, or images similar to clipart.\n\nWe advise that authors should generally acknowledge the use of GenAI in this case, and they\nshould carefully check images for bias and accuracy.\n\nAuthors should be aware that, in the US and\nmany other jurisdictions, it is not possible to claim copyright in non-human created works even if any\nhuman additions/edits may be copyrightable.\n\nThere are unresolved legal questions regarding\npossible copyright infringement both as a result of the training of GenAI programs on works under\ncopyright, and as a result of output that might closely resemble works under copyright (see, for\nexample, the US Congressional Research Service, \u201cgenai and Copyright\nLaw\u201d, Updated September 29, 2023,\n\n ).\n\nThere is also significant variability\nin the acceptability of GenAI-generated images based on the publication venue.\n\n**_When and how should the corresponding author inform a journal of manuscript elements created by_**\n**_GenAI, if not explicitly required to disclose by the publisher and when not obviously using or studying_**\n**_GenAI?\n\nExamples may be a proposed cover image, a graphical depiction of a new method, a graph_**\n**_containing research-generated data, a set of test data, generation of derivative data, etc._**\n\nGenAI technology is increasingly being built into services that provide grammar checks, polish\nlanguage, and proofreading.\n\nGeneral purpose tools such as ChapGPT are also effective for these\ntasks.\n\nIt is not usual to acknowledge the use of checking and suggestion tools.\n\nGenAI tools, like\nhuman proofreaders who may not understand the subject matter in detail, can suggest changes that\nchange the intended meaning so authors must still verify suggestions with care.\n\nCommercial checking\nand suggestion tools are being extended with GenAI features to draft entire sections or articles, or\nsummarize texts, so authors should consider when their use crosses the line into generative use as\ndefined above.\n\n**_When and how should research group leaders (e.g., faculty) communicate these expectations of_**\n**_appropriate/ethical/responsible use of GenAI in research to researchers who are undergraduate_**\n**_students?\n\nGraduate students?\n\nPostdoctoral researchers?\n\nOther research staff?_**\n\nEducating about the responsible use of GenAI should become part of the regular training on\nresearch methodology and norms of the respective discipline.\n\nThis includes training that research\nleaders provide, but it also is a responsibility of Cornell to educate faculty and students on the\naffordances and pitfalls of GenAI tools.", "## C. Research Translation Stage\n\n**_If an invention is reduced to practice in part by use of genai, how should the inventors document_**\n**_and inform others when considering a disclosure of invention or copyright?_**\n\nAny use of GenAI in the conception and reduction to practice of an invention or generation of\ncopyrighted materials should be carefully documented and disclosed to the Center For Technology\nLicensing by the inventors/authors.\n\nFor example, as to the conception and reduction to practice:\n\n-  What was the GenAI tool used?\n\n-  What were the inputs to the GenAI?\n\nDo you have rights to the data used for input?\n\n-----\n\n-  What were the outputs of the GenAI?\n\n-  How did the outputs of the GenAI, if at all, lead to the conception of any aspect of the invention?\n\n-  Were there any difficulties encountered in using the GenAI to yield the outputs desired and, if so,\nwhich researchers updated use of the GenAI, model and/or data to yield the desired

sought, the nature and extent\nof the use of GenAI, if containing more than _de minimis_ genai-generated material, must be disclosed,\nand what part of the work was created by the researchers and what part of the work was created\nby the GenAI.\n\n**_How should the researcher inform themselves of the uncompensated contributions of others to the GenAI_**\n**_output used in their own creative and/or copyrighted work or invention?\n\nHow does this responsibility_**\n**_depend on whether the researcher derives personal financial benefit (e.g., royalties on published book)_**\n**_from the research outcome?_**\n\nThere are pending class action copyright suits by authors against entities owning GenAI tools.\n\nIn\nthose suits, GenAI tools are alleged to utilize existing copyrighted works for training without\ncompensation to the authors.\n\nCommercial purpose is an important factor in the determination of fair\nuse.\n\nFor research that leads to commercialization and publications with financial benefits, it will be\nsafer to use GenAI tools that are trained using only public domain works.\n\nFor data that the\nresearchers put into GenAI themselves, it\u2019s important that they make sure they have the rights to do\nso regardless of whether they expect financial benefits from the output of GenAI.", "#### Overview\n\nCornell\u2019s leadership recognizes the opportunity and

highlighting the need for caution when using genai (such as ChatGPT,\n\netc.)\n\nwith personal and/or sensitive information and the need to protect confidential\n\ndata.\n\nAnother area of concern is the possibility that inappropriate use of these tools will\n\ninterfere with your ability to successfully engage with and master course material,\n\ngiven the potential that they create for academic dishonesty.\n\nBelow is the University\u2019s\n\npolicy regarding the use of genai in your courses.\n\n1.\n\nThis new technology offers numerous ways to support your education, such as\n\nmaking study guides or flash cards or providing help with understanding difficult\n\nconcepts.\n\nHowever, misuse of genai impedes the University\u2019s mission to develop the\n\ngifts and talents that you bring to the ND community, and using it as a substitute\n\nfor genuine engagement with your coursework runs counter to the heart of\n\neducation itself.\n\nThink carefully about the difference between supplementing your\n\neducation and replacing it.\n\n2.\n\nWith this in mind, remember that representing work that you did not produce as\n\nyour own, including work generated or materially modified by genai, constitutes\n\nacademic dishonesty.\n\nUse of genai in a way that violates an instructor\u2019s\n\narticulated policy, or using it to complete coursework in a way not expressly\n\npermitted

knowledge and understanding and report on the\nguidance which has been provided and how they may or may not include it in their\nwork.\n\nThis is to complement and not substitute for engagement with formative tasks,\nand guidance from teaching staff, Learning Enhancement Tutors, Academic\nLibrarians and others and the University.\n\n-  **genai as tutor** -  explanations can be provided to gain understanding.\n\nInspiration and ideas can be provided.\n\ngenai can help develop thinking by checking\nresponses, providing counterarguments and generating questions.\n\nStudents should\nalways check genai output against their own knowledge and understanding, and other\nsources, as content can be inaccurate biased and misleading.\n\n-  **genai as a team member** -  team working is an important workplace skill,\nand genai can be used by a team of students to act as a virtual member,\nmaybe playing a role which other students might find awkward or difficult, e.g.\n\nasking\nfor a counterargument or acting as a disrupter.\n\nStudents do not need to take the\nadvice of the genai and must be critical and evaluate the output before it is used.\n\n-  **genai as researcher** -doing a literature search is a crucial part of starting\nmost items of assessment.\n\ngenai can be used to surface relevant literature,\nhowever students should be aware that references can be fictional, not current and\n\n\n-----\n\nnon-exhaustive.\n\nThere are certainly better and more accurate tools to surface\nresearch papers.\n\n5.1.2 There are a number of \u2018red light\u2019 activities where

misinformation, missing information, and hallucinations (false information).\n\nStudents should always check the content against their own knowledge and\nunderstanding.\n\n-  Students should not use genai as the first step in their thinking (i.e.\n\nto\nimmediately ask the computer the exact question that they have been asked).\n\n-  Students should not circumvent their learning, e.g.\n\nwhen asked to reflect on a task or\noutput from a task.\n\n-  Students should not rely on genai when working in an important context\nwhere the student is reliant on the generated output being correct (e.g.\n\nlegal contexts\nsuch as placement risk assessments).\n\n-  Students should not use content or ideas from genai without appropriate\ncitation.\n\n-  Students should be aware of privacy and GDPR and not input personal and private\ninformation about themselves or others.\n\nThis is because the software will store data\nand information and potentially use it for other content.\n\n-

\u2018C\u2019 was the closest to a correct answer it is not wholly accurate as it fails\nto acknowledge the more nuanced balance of powers or partial separation which exists in\nthe British constitution.\n\nSo whilst acceptable could also be used as a teaching tool to prompt\na more in depth evaluation by the students.\n\nI then asked ChatGPT the question \u2018To what extent is there separation of powers in the\nBritish constitution?\u2019\n\n_The concept of separation of powers, as traditionally seen in other constitutional systems like_\n_that of the United States, is not as rigidly defined in the British constitution.\n\nThe British_\n_constitution is characterized by a fusion of powers, where the executive (Prime Minister and_\n_Cabinet), legislative (Parliament), and judicial (courts) branches are interconnected to some_\n_degree.\n\nHere's an overview of the extent of separation of powers in the British constitution:_\n\n-  **_Executive and Legislative Branches:_** _Unlike some systems, the Prime Minister and_\n_Cabinet are drawn from the majority party in the House of Commons, which blurs the_\n_separation between the executive and legislative branches.\n\nThis enables the_\n_executive to have significant influence and control over the legislative process._\n\n-  **_Parliamentary Sovereignty:_** _The British Parliament is supreme and can make or_\n_change laws without significant limitations from other branches.\n\nWhile this provides_\n_some degree of separation, it also means that the executive (government) is_\n_accountable to the legislature, blurring the lines further._\n\n-  **_Judiciary and Legislature:_** _The British judiciary is independent and can review laws_\n_and government actions for their legality and constitutionality.\n\nHowever, the_\n_judiciary's role in reviewing legislation passed by Parliament is limited compared to_\n_systems with a more robust separation of powers._\n\n-  **_Cabinet Members in Parliament:_** _Members of the Cabinet are drawn from the_\n_Parliament, and this dual role further integrates the executive and legislative_\n_branches._\n\n-  **_Constitutional Conventions and Royal Prerogatives:_** _The Crown still possesses_\n_certain prerogative powers that are exercised by the executive, which can influence_\n_the legislative process.\n\nHowever, many of these powers are now exercised by_\n_ministers in the government._\n\n\n-----\n\n_In summary, while the British constitution lacks the strict separation of powers seen in some_\n_other systems, there are mechanisms in place to maintain a balance between the branches._\n_The British tradition relies heavily on conventions, practices, and historical arrangements_\n_that have evolved over centuries.\n\nThis fusion of powers is based on a delicate balance that_\n_seeks to prevent any one branch from becoming too dominant and to ensure accountability._\n\nMy Evaluation: This answer was accurate, in so far as it relatively superficially correctly\nidentified key elements of the principle as it operates in the UK.\n\nIt did not, however, provide\nany authority or specific examples to

instructors are providing\n\nspecific guidance about appropriate use of genai in their courses.\n\nIf you do not know whether your use\n\nof genai is appropriate to the outcomes in your course or research activities, tell your instructor or\n\nsupervisor what you are considering and ask for guidance.\n\nDo this well in advance of your deadlines, not after\n\nyou have submitted your work.\n\nRemember that academic and research integrity are a core part of your experience as a student.\n\nDisclosing\n\nyour research methods, using proper citations when incorporating other\u2019s work, and contributing original\n\nintellectual work as an author are central tenets for ethical scholarly work.\n\nAs an author, you take full\n\nresponsibility for your writing and the evidence supporting it, including attribution of sources such as\n\ngenai.\n\nIt should be used as a resource to facilitate your learning, not a replacement for your education.\n\nJust like personal items, keep your data safe - and beware of scams.\n\nDo not provide personal information\n\nabout yourself or others that is not public, and always follow MSU\u2019s data guidance.\n\nIf you use genai, be sure to use\n\nreputable, recognized sources, and never share your credentials with a third party, no matter how legitimate\n\nthey may seem.\n\nKnow the potential risks and limitations of genai outputs.\n\nResults might include misinformation, inaccuracies, bias,\n\nor inappropriate or unintentionally harmful content.\n\nThroughout the year, we will be engaging in thoughtful conversations with the MSU community and experts about\n\nthe ethical use of these new technologies in ways that align with the university\u2019s mission and values.\n\nWe will\n\ncontinue to share additional guidance and reminders as those conversations progress.\n\nWe look forward to learning\n\nand using these new technologies in scholarly, equitable, and ethical ways.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThomas D.

should the UK take to build national capability for genai?\n\n**\n\nThe rapid rollout of genai\nmodels, and public attention to Open genai\u2019s\nChatGPT, has raised concerns about genai\u2019s\nimpact on the economy and society.\n\nIn\nthe UK, policy makers are looking to large\nlanguage models and other so-called\nfoundation models as ways to potentially\nimprove economic productivity.\n\nThis policy brief from Dr Ann Kristin\nGlenster and Sam Gilbert outlines which\npolicy levers could support those goals.\n\nThey argue that the UK should pursue\nbecoming a global leader in applying\ngenai to the economy.\n\nRather\nthan use public support for building new\nfoundation models, the UK could support\nthe growing ecosystem of startups that\ndevelop new applications for these\nmodels, creating new products and\nservices.\n\nA UK approach to genai could\nleverage the existing national strengths\nin safe, responsible and ethical genai to\nput human safety and flourishing at\nthe forefront of innovation.\n\nA national\napproach could achieve these goals by\nincreasing understanding of and access\nto genai tools throughout the\neconomy and society.\n\nThis policy brief answers three key\nquestions:\n\n1.\n\nWhat **policy infrastructure and social**\n**capacity** does the UK need to lead and\nmanage deployment of responsible\ngenai (over the long term)?\n\n2.\n\nWhat **national capability** does the UK\nneed for large-scale genai systems in the\nshort- and medium-term?\n\nThanks to Ann Kristin and Sam\u2019s\nextensive research, this policy brief\nmaps out an ethical framework for the\ngovernance of genai, through the\ncreation of an genai Bill.\n\nWe hope that this policy brief will be\nuseful to a wide range of stakeholders\nand address how we can use regulatory\nand legislative power today, to ensure\nthat the British public can trust how this\ntechnology is used.\n\nWe are also excited that this policy brief\nbrings together expertise from three\ngroups at the University of Cambridge:\nthe Bennett Institute for Public Policy,\nMinderoo Centre for Technology and\nDemocracy and genai@cam.\n\nEvidenced-based, science-informed\nresearch like this brief is what our three\norganisations do best, and we hope that\nour insights can help decision-makers\nnavigate public debates and policy\nchoices with more clarity.", "**Our main findings and recommendations are as follows:**\n\n**\u2022** genai represents a significant\ntechnological advance, of comparable\nimportance to the web, and offers a\nmaterial opportunity for the United\nKingdom (UK) to improve economic\nproductivity\n\n**\u2022** The aspiration for the UK to become\na global leader in the development of\nthe foundation models that support\ngenai products and services\nis unrealistic given the capital\ninvestment and compute capacity\nrequired\n\n**\u2022** The UK should focus on being a leader\nin applying foundation models in the\nreal world, to change _how_ things are\nproduced, responsibly, safely, and\nfairly\n\n**\u2022** Expanding understanding of\nand access to genai tools\nthroughout the economy and society\nis the most important way that the UK\ncan build capacity in responsible genai\nimplementation\n\n**\u2022** Innovation and skills policy levers\ncan be applied to this challenge,\nincluding lobbying major cloud\ncomputing infrastructure providers\nto establish GPU-clusters in the\nUK, and introducing tax incentives\nfor businesses to apply generative\ngenai technologies to their existing\noperations\n\n\n\n**\u2022** There are potential legal, regulatory,\ncultural and societal impediments to\nthe adoption of genai which\nneed to be addressed, including\nuncertainty over the applicability of\ndata protection, intellectual property,\nand product safety laws\n\n**\u2022** The sectoral approach to regulation\nbased on value-based principles\nrather than enforceable legislation\nmeans there is a risk that regulators\nwill lack the capacity to enforce\ntheir regulatory frameworks, or that\nsectoral regulatory frameworks\nwill develop with contradictory and\nincoherent rules\n\n**\u2022** Currently, the UK\u2019s approach to\nregulating genai combines\nvalue-based sectoral regulation\nwith efforts to shape international\nagreements.\n\nAs a result, businesses\nlack incentives to comply with\nResponsible genai principles, with\nnegative consequences for public\ntrust in organisations\u2019 use of\ngenai\n\n**\u2022** We believe this can be addressed\nthrough an genai Bill and sectoral\nlegislation designed to embed an\nethical framework for the governance\nof genai in domestic law, along\nwith investment in strengthening\nregulatory capacity\n\n\n-----\n\n-----", "**This policy brief aims to give the policy community an overview of the generative**\n\n**genai field.\n\n**\n\n\nIt highlights the key policy issues raised\nby its rapid development and adoption\n( **section 2** ).\n\nWe focus in particular on the questions\nof what is needed for the UK to unlock\nthe productivity improvements promised\nby genai ( **section 3** ), and what\nimpediments will need to be addressed\nto reconcile genai with emerging\nlegal and ethical frameworks ( **section 4** ).\n\nFinally, we make a set of\nrecommendations for building\ncapabilities to augment productivity\nthrough genai ( **section 5** ).\n\nExplanatory infographics, case\nstudies, and a glossary of generative\ngenai terminology (denoted by **_italics_** ) are\ninterspersed throughout.\n\nWe note that genai is a contested term.\n\nFor the purposes of this brief, we\nassume a narrow definition of genai, taking\nit to mean computer systems which can\nimprove themselves without explicit\ninstructions, by making inferences\nfrom patterns in data.\n\nThe \u2018genai\u2019 we are concerned with is the\nkind that (among other things) organises\nsocial media newsfeeds, determines the\nsentiment of online comments, decides\nwhich adverts should be displayed on\na webpage, classifies medical images,\nor recommends music, films, or books\npeople might enjoy based on what they\nhave previously consumed.\n\nWe recognise the debate about\nthe potential for developments in\ngenai research to engender machine\nsuperintelligence that poses an\nexistential risk to humanity, but do not\nenter into it here \u2013 not least because _AI_\n_Safety_ is already addressed extensively\nelsewhere as the focus of the **UK\u2019s**\n**Frontier genai Taskforce** .\n\n1\n\nWe likewise acknowledge important\ncritiques which have drawn attention to\nthe ways genai systems can reproduce bias\nand injustice, taking as a given that all genai\nshould be **responsible genai** .\n\n2", "**2.1 What is genai capable of and how does it work?\n\n**\n\ngenai involves running the kind of\npattern-matching that machine learning\nsystems do, only **in reverse** .\n\n3 Rather\nthan looking at data and finding existing\nexamples that fit a particular pattern, it\ndraws on data to \u2018generate\u2019 new examples\nof that pattern.\n\ngenai systems can\ntherefore output original high-quality text,\nimages, audio, or video at mindboggling\nspeed and scale.\n\nMuch of the excitement about generative\ngenai has been driven by the runaway\npopularity of ChatGPT, a consumer facing\napp developed by OpenAI, which reached\n100 million users **even faster than the**\n**app TikTok** .\n\n4\n\nChatGPT is underpinned by a type of\ngenai system called a _large_\n_language model_ (LLM).\n\nLLMs take\ninstructions (or _prompts_ ) from users in\nnatural language, and then output text\nin response\u2014from stump speeches to\nShakespearean sonnets and everything\nin between.\n\nThey work by predicting what word (or,\nstrictly, _token_ ) ought to come next in a\nsequence, based on inferences from the\nvast corpus of data on which they have\nbeen _trained_ , together with the user\u2019s\ninstructions.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 is the\nbest-known LLM, there are many other\nexamples (see **Figure 2** ).\n\nAlthough image-generation models like\nMidjourney use a different process called\n_diffusion_ , from the perspective of the user\nthey work in the same way as LLMs.\n\nNatural language text prompts can\nyield **Van Gogh-inspired cover art for**\n**\u2018Stairway to Heaven\u2019, Pope Francis in a**\n**Balenciaga puffer jacket** , or more or less\nanything else than can be imagined and\narticulated.\n\n5", "**2.2 genai\u2019s limitations**\n\nAt first sight these capabilities can seem\nmiraculous, but it is important to be aware\nof their limitations.\n\nDiffusion models are\nnot underpinned by an understanding of\nthe physical world; **they don\u2019t \u2018know\u2019** what\ntext symbols mean, or that human hands\nusually have five fingers.\n\n6\n\nThe results can be comical, nightmarish,\nor simply wrong.\n\nSimilarly, LLMs do not\nfunction like search engines, reliably\nretrieving information from a database.\n\nRather, LLMs generate new text\nprobabilistically, meaning that they\noften invent facts and refer to seemingly\nplausible but non-existent academic\nstudies and URLs (a phenomenon known\nas \u2018hallucination\u2019).\n\nOvercoming these limitations requires\na combination of _fine-tuning_ , _prompt_\n_engineering_ , and _plugins_ .", "**2.3 Foundation models vs applications**\n\nBoth LLMs and diffusion models are types\nof _foundation model_ \u2014a term describing\nmodels that others could \u2018build on top\nof\u2019 for many different purposes.\n\nThis is\nenabled by giving third-party developers\n_API access_ , allowing them to incorporate\nfoundation model capabilities into their\napplications.\n\nNew startups have been able to develop\nsoftware-as-a-service ( _SaaS_ ) products\nthat apply foundation models in specific\ncontexts.\n\nFor example, **Harvey genai** uses OpenAI\u2019s\nGPT models in products designed to\nassist lawyers with research, contract\ndrafting, and document review.\n\n7\n\nEstablished tech companies have\nenhanced their products with generative\ngenai features.\n\nFor example, the graphic\ndesign platform Canva introduced a\n**text to image feature** powered by the\nDALL-E 2 model, and Microsoft added\nLLM-powered writing and editing features\nto its **Office 365 products** .\n\n8", "**2.4 The economics of genai**\n\nProviders of foundation models earn\nrevenue by charging a small fee for\neach API request.\n\nAs a result, their\nbusiness model depends on the volume\nof API requests from applications being\nsufficient to offset the massive _compute_\ncosts involved in developing and\noperating foundation models.\n\nThese costs are partly a function of\nthe vast size of training datasets.\n\nFor\nexample, the text used to train OpenAI\u2019s\nGPT-3 model included a **45 terabyte**\n**archive of the web** , 11,000 books, and\nthe entirety of Wikipedia.\n\n9\n\nProcessing such large quantities of\ndata requires Graphics Processing\nUnits (GPUs).\n\nA single GPU designed by\nmarket-leader Nvidia costs $10,000;\nand thousands of GPUs are needed to\ntrain a single foundation model.\n\nFurther\ncompute costs accrue once models are\nreleased and begin processing prompts\nfrom users.\n\n6.\n\nMirjalili, Seyedali.\n\n2023.\n\n\u201cIf genai Image Generators Are so Smart, Why Do They Struggle to Write and

million per month to run, and that\nMicrosoft would need $4 billion of\ncompute if its GPT-powered Bing Chat\nproduct responded to all queries from\nBing\u2019s users.\n\n10\n\nA final nuance to note is that it is\nnot necessary for foundation model\ndevelopers to own GPUs themselves\u2014\nthey can rent GPU time from cloud\nproviders as a service.Currently, most\nreal-world end users of genai\nsystems are paying nothing for the\nprivilege, meaning foundation model\nproviders\u2019 revenues are negligible \u2013\nOpenAI projects just $200 million\nfor 2023.\n\nBoth development and usage of\ngenai is therefore currently\nbeing funded by venture capital and\nthe balance sheets of big tech\ncompanies \u2013 a situation which will\nclearly not last forever.", "**Examples** **Value

sections.\n\nWhile the\nUK has not adopted specific legislation\nto regulate genai, there are some\nrestrictions in existing laws, notably\nconcerning personal data protection\nand intellectual property.\n\nFurther, there is an impediment to\nthe uptake of national capabilities in\ngenai in that these technologies\nare considered unethical and\nuntrustworthy by some.\n\n36 Thus, national\ncapability will depend on generative\ngenai tools which are reliable, safe,\nresponsible, and trustworthy.\n\nWe have identified how generative\ngenai can unlock the UK\u2019s potential for\n\n\naugmented productivity by changing\nthe ways things are produced.\n\nHowever,\nthere are several impediments to UK\nbusinesses\u2019 access to and use of\ngenai.\n\n**Figure 3** sets out some of the chief\nlegal, regulatory, economic, cultural, and\nsocietal impediments to the adoption\nof genai in the UK.\n\nThis section\ngives an overview of impediments to\nthe uptake of genai in the UK.\n\nIt\nspecifically addresses risks associated\nwith genai and what is meant by\nethical and responsible genai.\n\nThe section also addresses the\nconcerns regarding, personal data,\nprivacy, and data governance,\nparticularly in relation to copyright,\nthat arise from the development and\nuse of genai tools.\n\n36.\n\n'Trustworthy genai' is a contested term.\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s Independent High-Level Expert Group on Artificial\nIntelligence identifies three components of Trustworthy genai: (1) it should be lawful, complying with all applicable laws and\nregulations; (2) it should be ethical, ensuring adherence to ethical principles and values; and (3) it should be robust, both\nfrom a technical and social perspective.\n\n-----\n\n|Impediment|Explanation|\n|---|---|\n|Legal & regulatory (Law & regulation can both be a facilitator and an impediment if too restrictive; the absence of law & regulation can also be an impediment)|There is currently no omnibus Bill in Parliament dedicated solely to regulating genai in the UK.\n\nThis is in contrast to other jurisdictions, especially the European Union (EU), where stringent legislation is being adopted.\n\nWhile the UK is considering regulating aspects of genai, notably through the Online Safety Bill and particularly through regulators, no legislative initiative specifci ally addresses genai or foundation models\u2014as illustrated by the examples below.\n\nThe UK Government has taken steps to regulate genai through a \u2018pro-innovation approach\u2019 by which the Government wants to use regulators to encourage business to adopt fvi e ethical principles when using genai.\n\nThe fvi e principles are modelled on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u2019s principles for the regulation of genai.\n\nThe UK has also signed up through its membership of the UNESCO recommendations on the Ethics of genai.\n\nWhile there is no specifci legislation for genai in the UK, the use of these technologies must still conform to existing law, such as the Data Protection Act 2018 or intellectual property laws.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Intellectual Property Ofcfi e is currently working on a draft code for copyright and genai that will address inter alia the contentious issue of text and database mining exceptions, which the Government had earlier proposed for the development of genai models and tools.\n\nThere is a chance that genai will be regulated through the regulatory framework being developed by the Competition & Markets Authority based on the regulator\u2019s new statutory powers in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill (DMCC), which is expected to enter into force in the second half of 2024.\n\nA recent report from the Competition & Markets Authority suggested a collection of principles to guide regulatory intervention in support of competitive genai markets, built on ready access to the materials to create foundation models, diversity of business models, choice for businesses in how to use foundation models and fel xibility for consumers in which provides to engage, the prevention of anti-competitive practices, and transparency about the risks and limitations of the foundation model products they are using.\n\nA cluster of policy initiatives also seek to set guardrails for genai development, with difef rent levels of implementation.\n\nFor example, while the UK has set out a data sharing governance framework as part of its national data strategy, it has not adopted specifci legislation to give efef ct to the framework in the private sector.\n\nIn contrast, the EU is adopting the Data Act and the Data Governance Act.\n\nIn contrast to the UK, the EU is adopting the genai Act, expected to come into force at the end of 2025.", "In contrast, the EU is adopting the Data Act and the Data Governance Act.\n\nIn contrast to the UK, the EU is adopting the genai Act, expected to come into force at the end of 2025.\n\nThe genai Act will regulate genai according to perceived risks: unacceptable risk (banned), high risk (transparency, oversight, and accountability requirements), and low-to-minimal risk (safety and user protection requirements).\n\nCanada has taken a similar approach with its Artifci ial Intelligence and Data Act.\n\nThe EU is also considering specifci genai product safety liability rules for how products are manufactured and how they should be used.\n\nSee for example the European Commission\u2019s proposal for an genai Liability Directive, or the work of the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT).\n\nWhile there are numerous initiatives to introduce legislation to regulate genai in the US, the US so far has encouraged voluntary self-regulation based on the White House\u2019s Blueprint for an genai Bill of Rights, setting out fvi e principles: (1) safe and efef ctive systems, (2) algorithmic discrimination protection, (3) data privacy, (4) notice and explanation, and (5) human alternatives, consideration and fallback.\n\nThe White House has also published a set of eight voluntary commitments pledged by leading companies in the genai industry.\n\nIn addition, in August 2023 it was announced that the Biden Administration is fast-tracking an Executive Order to address risks associated with genai.|\n\n\n_Figure 3: Impediments to the uptake of genai in the UK_\n\n\n-----\n\n|Impediment|Explanation|\n|---|---|\n|Legal & regulatory (Law & regulation can both be a

the Governor of California\u2019s recent Executive Order N-12-23 on genai, and domain-specifci guidance on the application of existing legislative, for example from blog posts by the Federal Trade Commission on consumer protections.\n\nThe US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has also developed a voluntary genai Risk Management Framework (AIRMF) and Senator Chuck Schumer has developed a SAFE Innovation Framework for the regulation of genai.\n\nIn addition, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission published a report on product safety and liability on genai in 2021.\n\nNumerous issues arise in relation to product liability and genai, including whether existing laws cover the systemic risk of harm or if a precautionary principle approach should be adopted, to whom liability should be assigned, and the resources and levers available to the regulators.\n\nThe Department for Business and Trade and the Ofcfi e for Product Safety and Standards are currently reviewing the UK\u2019s product safety regime post-Brexit, which ofef rs an opportunity to also consider the need for national genai product safety standards.\n\nThe Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge have set up a taskforce to draft a legislative proposal for the protection of workers and the use of genai.\n\nThe taskforce will particularly examine risks associated with privacy, insecurity of work, and discrimination from the deployment of genai.|\n|Technical|There are technical limitations to the capabilities genai can

in\ngenai becomes so pervasive that\nthe deployment of these technologies is\nrejected by businesses and the public.\n\nSecond, there is the risk that generative\ngenai will be subjected to legal and ethical\nregimes which will be overly restrictive\nand thus hamper its full potential.\n\nThird, the issue with genai hallucinations,\nwhereby the genai tool makes up\ninformation, alongside other technical\nlimitations, poses a challenge to their\nreliability which again is an impediment to\ntheir uptake nationally.", "**4.1 Risks with genai**\n\nThis section briefly examines risks\nassociated with genai and\nthe legal and ethical frameworks\nthat are emerging to address these.\n\nFundamentally, the British public must\nbe able to trust the use of genai.\n\nThere are many conceptualisations of\nrisks associated with genai.\n\nThe list below is not intended to be\nread as a complete overview, but rather\na list of some of the most prominent\nconcerns related to genai.\n\nNumerous risks\nare associated with genai,\nincluding risks to personal data, privacy,\nand intellectual property.\n\nThere are\nrisks that due to lack of transparency\nor accountability, genai may\nproduce unreliable outcomes, or be\nused for hidden or unacceptable\noutcomes.\n\nKey concerns with genai\napplications are the reliability or\nveracity of the outputs, especially as\nthe capacity of non-technical users to\nproduce deepfake images, audio, and\nvideo abounds.\n\nScholars have also identified risks of\nnegative environmental consequences,\nthe overrepresentation of hegemonic\nviewpoints and value-lock in training\ndata, the risk of propagating toxic\nstereotypes and racist, sexist, and\nableist ideologies, marginalising\ncommunities, violating personal data,\nand subjecting people to abusive\nlanguage, hate speech, microaggressions, derogating language,\ndehumanising and denigrating content\nand framing, which could lead to\npsychological harm.\n\n37\n\n\n37.\n\nEmily M.

violates\ncopyright laws, or that the foundation\nmodels will reproduce bias, which may\nproduce illegal outcomes, especially\nwhen genai is used in the\ncontext of social services, policing, and\neducation.\n\nThe cumulative effect of\nthese risks is the erosion of trust in the\ntechnology, and of societal trust overall.\n\nAccording to the Ada Lovelace Institute:\n\u201cIt is also unlikely that international\nagreements will be effective in making genai\nsafer and preventing harm, unless they\nare underpinned by robust domestic\nregulatory frameworks that can shape\ncorporate

2023), pp.\n\n8-9.\n\n-----\n\nHowever, this approach may pose\nchallenges in ensuring that regulators\nhave the incentives, resources, or\nmandate to do so, especially as many\nregulators\u2019 remits are constrained by\nstatutory language.\n\nThus, the approach\nhas been challenged by **leading**\n**academics** , pointing to the need for more\nholistic thinking.\n\nIt is also problematic that the\nGovernment\u2019s principles are so vague as\nto be nearly vacuous.\n\n40 It is, for example,\ndifficult to discern with any certainty\nwhether the principles are focused on\noutcomes or how those outcomes are\nto be achieved.\n\nHowever, elsewhere, for example in\ndata protection, the Government has\nsuggested that regulation should be based\non outcomes; an approach that could\npotentially be taken for the five valuebased principles as well.\n\n(Department\nfor Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, **Data:**\n**A new direction** , 10 September 2021,\nupdated 23 June 2023, p.\n\n7.)\n\nAs the principles are not legally\nbinding, it is unlikely that businesses\nwill have an adequate incentive to\nadopt all the principles unless there are\ncompelling competitive advantages to\ndoing so.\n\nWhile the Government has\nprovided tools such as the Algorithmic\nTransparency Recording Standard, which\naims to support the implementation of\nethical genai principles, the extent to which\nsuch tools are being implemented in\npractice is not clear.\n\nThus, the Ada Lovelace Institute has\nnoted that: \u201cThe principles will not\n\u2013 initially \u2013 be placed on a statutory\nfooting, and so regulators will have\nno legal obligation to take them into\naccount, although the Government has\nsaid it will consider introducing a \u2018duty\n\n\nto have regard\u2019 to the principles.\u201d (Ada\nLovelace, _Regulating genai in the UK_ , p.\n\n16.)\n\nThe **House of Commons Science,**", "**Innovation and Technology Committee**\n\nhas criticised the Government\u2019s\nunwillingness to consider genai-specific\nlegislation, noting that: \u201c[t]here is\na growing imperative to ensure\ngovernance and regulatory frameworks\nare not left irretrievably behind the\npace of technological innovation.\u201d ( **The**\n**governance of genai;**\n**interim report** , Ninth Report of Session\n2022-23, p.\n\n3.).\n\nThus, rather than see legislation as an\nimpediment to the development of the\nUK\u2019s competitiveness in genai,\nwe echo the sentiment of the review\nof the digital technologies, led by Sir\nPatrick Vallance, that: \u201cWell-designed\nregulation and standards can have a\npowerful effect on driving growth and\nshaping a thriving digital economy.\u201d (HM\nGovernment, **Pro-innovation Regulation**\n**of Technologies Review: Digital**\n**Technologies** (March 2023), p.\n\n3.)\n\nWhile calls for legislation are mounting,\nit does not mean that the content of genai\nlegislation is self-evident.\n\nLegal rules\nthat are too specific risk being quickly\noutdated while principles that are too\nbroad or vague risks being meaningless.\n\nThe challenge is therefore how to find\nthe regulatory approach that will be\nrobust and future-proof.\n\nLegislation\nwould also clarify the chain of liability\nthroughout the value-chain and lifecycle\nof genai.\n\nFor example, the\nAll-Party Parliamentary Group on Data\nAnalytics (APGDA) has noted that:\n\u201cthere are issues around transparency,\nexplainability, and accountability in\nrelation to third party/outsourced genai\nsystem development.\n\n40.\n\nThe Central Digital and Data Office expounded on these principles in its Data Ethics Framework for the use of digital\ntechnologies, including genai, in 2020.\n\nHowever, this guide is only for the public sector and does not have the force of law.\n\n-----\n\nFor example, attention was drawn to the\ndifficulty of testing for bias in third party\nsystems.\u201d (Policy Connect, **An Ethical genai**", "**Future: Guardrails & catalysts to make**\n\n**genai a force for good** ,\n19 June 2023, p.\n\n10.)\n\nLegislation could clarify the standards\nand responsibility of testing that would\nbefall UK businesses using third-party\ngenai systems.A key issue with\napplying the law or ethical principles\nto genai is that the outcome\nis personalised or bespoke, therefore\nmaking predictability or comparison\ndifficult.\n\n\u201cGenerated content is\nprobabilistically and randomly generated\nbased on certain input (or \u2018prompts\u2019),\nwhich are usually written by a human.\n\n\"Therefore, the output of any given\ngenai model is likely to be different\nfor each person prompting the model\nand may both resemble patterns in the\ntraining data or appear to be something\ncompletely new.\u201d (Forbrukerr\u00e5det, **Ghost in**\n**the Machine: Addressing the consumer**\n**harms of genai** , June 2023, p.\n\n8.)\n\nA **recent review** of 10 foundation models\nfound that none met the compliance\nrequirements set out in the EU\u2019s draft\ngenai Act.\n\nThere is a question of whether\ngenai should go through an\napproval or vetting process before being\nused, or if redress and contestability\nshould be used as a deterrent for\nunacceptable practices.\n\nAccountable\nprinciples also means that there must be\nways to audit the genai systems,\nwhich will require access to data for\nresearchers and for regulators.\n\nA right to access to data for researchers\nin relation to the processing of personal\ndata has been proposed included in the\n**Online Safety Bill** in relation to the online\n\n\ninformation environment, but this has\nyet to be adopted by Parliament.\n\nFurther\nthere are no legal stipulations for data\naccess in the legislative pipeline with\nregard to genai in the UK.", "**4.3 Personal data and privacy concerns**\n\nMany of the ethical concerns regarding\ngenai are linked to the use\nof personal data and privacy.\n\nThese\nconcerns span personal data that\nis being inputted into genai\nsystems, personal data generated by\nthese systems, and uses of genai\nsystems for surveillance.\n\nSome of these fears should be alloyed\nwith the **Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA)**\nand its forthcoming replacement, the", "**Data Protection and Digital Information**\n\n**(No.\n\n2) Bill** .\n\nThe UK\u2019s data protection\nframework is based on the EU\u2019s **General**\n**Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** ,\nwhich includes the stipulation that all\nprocessing of personal data must adhere\nto the data processing principles.\n\nThe data processing principles\nare: (1) lawfulness, fairness, and\ntransparency; (2) purpose limitation;\n(3) data minimisation; (4) accuracy;\n(5) storage limitation; (6) integrity and\nconfidentiality; and (7) accountability.\n\nThat means that all uses of personal data\nby genai must respect these\nprinciples as a matter of law.\n\nAs the legislation covers all forms of\npersonal data its remit is broader than\nprocessing that concerns privacy.\n\nThe legal definition of personal\ndata is technologically neutral and\ncomprehensive to ensure that all forms\nof personal data falls under its scope.\n\n-----\n\nThe broadness of the definition has\nimplications for the use of generative\ngenai and may pose a considerable\nimpediment from the uptake of these\ntechnologies by UK companies.\n\nThe\nCourt of Justice of the European Union\n(CJEU) has for example ruled that an\n**IP address can be personal data** when\ncombined with other factors held by\nthird parties.\n\nRegardless of where in the process\npersonal data is generated or the sources\nfrom which it is harvested, including\npublic domain sources, or provided\ndirectly (and voluntarily) by an individual,\nall the data processing principles still\napply in full.\n\nThere are further restrictions\non the use of sensitive data, which\nposes challenges for companies using\ngenai as sensitivity may first\nbecome apparent once the system has\ngenerated output data.\n\nThe use of genai poses several\nchallenges when it comes to compliance\nwith data protection law.\n\nIt may not be\napparent whether data is personal or not,\nor the system may generate personal\ndata unbeknown or unintended by the\ncreator of the genai system.\n\nHowever, it\nmust be noted that the DPA is not a\nprivacy statute, and that the objective\nof the legislation is not to preclude the\nprocessing of personal data, but instead\nto ensure that the processing is legal.\n\nThus, the DPA does not automatically\nprevent the generation and use of\npersonal data in genai.\n\n41", "**Article 3 of the DPA defines personal data as:**\n\n**_\u201c\u2026any information relating to an identified_**\n**_or identifiable living individual\u2026 [meaning] a_**\n**_living individual who can be identified, directly_**\n**_or indirectly, in particular by reference to: (a)_**\n**_an identifiers such as a name, an identification_**\n**_number, location data or an online identifier, or_**\n**_(b) one or more factors specific to the physical,_**\n**_physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural_**\n**_or social identity of the individual.\u201d_**\n\nThe UK Government clearly recognises\nthe role personal data has in innovation\nand genai.\n\nIn its **White Paper on data** , the\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media\n& Sport writes that: \u201cInnovative uses\nof personal data are at the forefront of\ndriving scientific discovery, and enabling\ncutting-edge technology, like artificial\nintelligence (genai)\u2026This means maintaining\na clear legal framework overseen by\na regulator that takes account of the\nbenefits of data use, while protecting\nagainst the harms that can come from\nusing personal data irresponsibly.\u201d (p. 6).\n\nThe objective of the White Paper on data\nis to use \u201cpersonal data responsibly\u201d\n(p.\n\n6.\n\n), which necessitates an ethical\nframework.\n\nOne of the drawbacks in the\ncontext of genai of the current\ndata protection regime is that it is\nfocussed on the right to data protection\nof the individuals and as such does not\naddress the potential for systemic risk of\nbias, discrimination, and inequality arising\nfrom the use of personal data at scale.\n\n41.\n\nHowever, several European data protection authorities are examining whether genai tools comply with the\nGDPR.\n\nNotably, the Italian data protection authority has placed a temporary ban on an OpenAI generative chatbot for\nfailing to provide information as required under the GDPR.\n\nThe Spanish Data Protection Authority is also investigating\nChatGPT for breaches of GDPR.\n\nFurthermore, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has set up a taskforce to\nexamine whether genai is compatible with the GDPR.\n\nIt must, however, also be noted that these concerns\nregard whether genai comport with the data-processing principles for the processing of personal data, not\nwhether they should be banned outright as illegal.\n\n-----", "**4.4 Data governance**\n\ngenai needs data and there is\ntherefore considerable concern and\ninterest in the data that goes into the\ntraining of foundation models and the\ndata that is input into genai\nsystems.\n\nThere is growing concern that generative\ngenai violates intellectual property rights.\n\nLegal challenges have been mounted\nin the US concerning the use of data\nscraping for training data which could\nviolate **copyright** .\n\ngenai has been front and\ncentre of the recent labour dispute and\n**strike** by the SAG-AFRA trade unions\nrepresenting actors in the US.\n\nWhether\nany legal dispute will be successful is\nhighly uncertain, however, the broader\npoint is that the labour force of the\ncreative industries is under threat from\ngenai, which will have a direct\neffect on the UK economy as these\nindustries represent **5.6% of GDP** .\n\n42\n\nAs mentioned above, the UK\u2019s Intellectual\nProperty Office is currently drafting a\n**code for genai and copyright** in an attempt\nto answer some of these questions.\n\nIn the meantime, there are signals of a\n**broader debate** about the societal value\nand risk associated with absorbing a\nlarge portion of human knowledge into\nlarge genai models, potentially impinging\non fundamental human rights, such as\naccess to culture.\n\nAs a countermeasure to copyright\nconcerns, there is a chance that\ncompanies will hold data in so-called\nwalled gardens.\n\nThat would give the public even less\naccess to open data and would stifle\ninnovation and productivity.\n\nThere is\nstill room for clarification of the legal\nframework in this regard.", "**4.5 Regulatory capacity**\n\nThe government\u2019s approach to genai\nregulation would support x\u00bdindividual\nregulators to develop sector-specific\nframeworks for the adoption of the\nvalue-based principles by UK industry.\n\nIn many ways, this is a more concrete\nand pragmatic approach than the\napproach taken by other jurisdictions,\nnotably the EU, where centralised,\noverarching principles have been\nadopted in comprehensive legislation.\n\nAs such, the UK is showing more\nwillingness to operationalise the\nprinciples in ways that will have a direct\nimpact on the development and uptake\nof genai.\n\nFor example, the Competition and\nMarkets Authority has **proposed a set of**\n**principles** to regulate the development\nof genai models.\n\n43 (Competition & Markets\nAuthority, **genai Foundation Models: Initial**\n**Report** , 18 September 2023.)\n\n42.\n\nSee \ncreative%20industries%20sector%20contributed,the%20UK%20economy%20in%202021.\n\n43.\n\nThe principles are: (1) ensuring that foundation model developers have access to data and computing power, and that early\ngenai developers do not gain an entrenched advantage; (2) that both closed and open source models are allowed to develop; (3)\nthat businesses have a range of options to access genai models \u2013 including developing their own; (4) that consumers should be\nable to use multiple genai providers; (5) that no anticompetitive conduct like 'bundling' genai models into other services take place;\n(6) that consumers and businesses are given clear information about use and limitations of genai models.\n\n-----\n\nThe effectiveness of the approach\ntaken by the Government will depend on\nregulatory capacity and there is a risk that\nefforts will be unnecessarily duplicated,\nor that regulatory frameworks will\npromote contradictory rules.\n\nThe **Sir Patrick Vallance Review** of\ndigital technologies, published in March\n2023, found more than 10 different\nregulators of digital technologies.\n\nWe\nconcur with others who have observed\na need for centralised regulatory\noversight to coordinate the efforts of\nthe many departments and regulators.\n\nThis is necessary to ensure that the\nUK\u2019s value-based principled framework\nfor the governance of genai is\nadopted in a consistent manner across\nthe UK\u2019s industrial sectors.\n\nThese functions are today met by the\n**Office for genai** and\nCentre for Data Ethics and Innovation\nunder the Department of Science,\nInnovation and Technology (DSIT),\nand the **Digital Regulation Cooperation**\n**Forum** , which was formed as a\nmembership organisation consisting\nof four key regulators: the Competition\n& Markets Authority, OFCOM, the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office, and\nthe Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nAlongside recent internal changes\nto Government\u2019s policy delivery\ninfrastructure, through the\nestablishment of DSIT, further changes\nto the Government\u2019s interactions with\nthe external expert community are also\nexpected, which may influence the\nability to rapidly identify and respond to\nemerging technological changes with\nregulatory implications.\n\n44", "**4.6 International leadership**\n\nThe UK Government has repeatedly\nset forth an ambition of international\nleadership in genai, both in terms of\ndevelopment and regulation.\n\nIn March\n2023, the **Sir Patrick Vallance Review**\nasserted that the UK had a window of\nno more than 24 months to realise that\nambition.\n\nIn relation to the development\nof regulatory frameworks, the UK is\nstruggling to keep pace, as suggested\nby **Figure 3** in an earlier section.\n\nWhile the UK\u2019s Government has resisted\ncalls for legislation to allow for growth\nand innovation in the sector, the lack of\ngenai-specific legal regulation opens the\npossibility that the safe and responsible\ndeployment of genai solutions and products\nwill depend on the enforcement of\nrules devised and overseen by other\njurisdictions or the international\ncommunity.\n\nThe absence of robust\nlegislation poses a serious risk to the\nsafety and trustworthiness of generative\ngenai solutions, especially when these are\ndevised wholly or in part by foreign\ncompanies.\n\nBeing first-to-the-post in adopting\nlegislation to regulate genai is not\nnecessarily a desirable objective if\nthat legislation is not robust, balanced,\nand feasible.\n\nHowever, the UK\u2019s lack of\nbinding regulation means that despite\nany ambition of the Government, the\nUK is failing to reach its ambition of\ninternational leadership in this regard.\n\n44.\n\nThe genai Council and Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation have recently come to the end of their term or been disbanded,\nwith plans for an alternative approach to external engagement in development.\n\n-----\n\n-----", "**Although the** **National genai Strategy** **is concerned with the broader genai field**\n\n**and pre-dates the latest developments in genai, many of the key**\n**actions it sets out retain their

have attracted widespread attention, optimism, and alarm ( The\n\nWhite House , 2022 ).\n\nThese technologies are all examples of \u201cgenai,\u201d a class of machine\n\nlearning technologies that can generate new content\u2014such as text, images, music, or video\u2014by\n\nanalyzing patterns in existing data.\n\nIn this section, we provide background on genai as a\n\ntechnology and discuss its potential economic implications.", "**1.1** **Technical Primer**\n\nThis paper focuses on an important class of genai, large language models (LLMs).\n\nLLMs\n\nare neural network models designed to process sequential data ( Bubeck et al.\n\n, 2023 ).\n\nAn LLM is\n\ntrained by learning to predict the next word in a sequence, given what has come before, using a large\n\ncorpus of text (such as Wikipedia, digitized books, or portions of the Internet).\n\nThis knowledge of\n\nthe statistical co-occurrence of words allows it to generate new text that is grammatically correct\n\nand semantically meaningful.\n\nThough \u201clarge language model\u201d implies human language, the same\n\ntechniques can be used to produce other forms of sequential data (\u201ctext\u201d) such as protein sequences,\n\naudio, computer code, or chess moves ( Eloundou et al.\n\n, 2023 ).\n\nRecent progress in genai has been driven by four factors: computing scale, earlier\n\ninnovations in model architecture, the ability to \u201cpre-train\u201d using large amounts of unlabeled data\n\nand refinements in training techniques.\n\n8\n\nFirst, the quality of LLMs is strongly dependent on scale: the amount of computing power used\n\nfor training, the number of model parameters, and dataset size ( Kaplan et al.\n\n, 2020 ).\n\nFirms are\n\nincreasingly devoting more resources to increasing this scale.\n\nThe GPT-3 model included 175 billion\n\nparameters, was trained on 300 billion tokens, and generated approximately $5 million dollars in\n\ncomputing costs alone; the GPT-4 model, meanwhile, is estimated to include 1.8 trillion parameters,\n\ntrained on 13 trillion tokens, at a rumored computing-only cost of $ 65 million ( Li , 2020 ; Brown et\n\nal.\n\n, 2020 ; Patel and Wong , 2023 )\n\n8 For a more detailed technical review of progress, see Radford and Narasimhan ( 2018 ); Radford et al.\n\n( 2019 ); Liu\net al.\n\n( 2023 ); Ouyang et al.\n\n( 2022 ).\n\n-----\n\nIn terms of model architecture, modern LLMs use two earlier key innovations: positional en-\n\ncoding and self-attention.\n\nPositional encodings keep track of the order in which a word occurs in\n\na given input.\n\n9 Meanwhile, self-attention assigns importance weights to each word in the context\n\nof the entire input text.\n\nTogether, this approach enables models to capture long-range semantic\n\nrelationships within an input text, even when that text is broken up into smaller segments and\n\nprocessed in parallel ( Vaswani et al.\n\n, 2017 ; Bahdanau et al.\n\n, 2015 ).\n\nNext, LLMs can be pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled data from sources such as Reddit\n\nor Wikipedia.\n\nBecause unlabeled data is much more prevalent than labeled data, LLMs can learn\n\nabout natural language on a much larger training corpus ( Brown et al.\n\n, 2020 ).\n\nBy seeing, for\n\ninstance, that the word \u201cyellow\u201d is more likely to be observed with \u201cbanana\u201d or \u201csun\u201d or \u201crubber\n\nduckie,\u201d the model can learn about semantic and grammatical relationships even without explicit\n\nguidance ( Radford and Narasimhan , 2018 ).\n\nThe resulting model can be used in multiple applications\n\nbecause its training is not specific to a particular set of tasks.\n\nFinally, general-purpose LLMs can be further \u201cfine-tuned\u201d to generate output that matches the\n\npriorities of any specific setting ( Ouyang et al.\n\n, 2022 ; Liu et al.\n\n, 2023 ).\n\nFor example, a model trained\n\nto generate social media content would benefit from receiving labeled data that contain not just\n\nthe content of a post or tweet, but also information on the amount of user engagement it received.\n\nSimilarly, an LLM may generate several potential responses to a given query, but some of them\n\nmay be factually incorrect or contain toxic language.\n\nTo discipline this model, human evaluators\n\ncan rank these outputs to train a reward function that prioritizes desirable responses.\n\nThese types\n\nof refinements can significantly improve model quality by making a general-purpose model better\n\nsuited to its specific application ( Ouyang et al.\n\n, 2022 ).\n\nTogether, these innovations have generated meaningful improvements in model performance.\n\nThe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) family of models, in particular, has attracted con-\n\nsiderable media attention for their rapidly expanding capabilities.\n\n10", "**1.2** **The Economic Impacts of genai**\n\nComputers have historically excelled at executing pre-programmed instructions, making them par-\n\nticularly effective at tasks that can be reduced to explicit rules ( Autor , 2014 ).\n\nConsequently, com-\n\nputerization has disproportionately reduced demand for workers performing \u201croutine\u201d tasks such\n\nas data entry, bookkeeping, and assembly line work, reducing wages in these jobs ( Acemoglu and\n\nAutor , 2011 ).\n\nAt the same time, computerization has also increased the demand for workers who\n\n9 For instance, a model would keep track of \u201cthe, 1\u201d instead of only \u201cthe\u201d (if \u201cthe\u201d was the first word in the sentence).\n\n10 For instance, GPT-4 has recently been shown to outperform humans in taking the US legal bar exam ( Liu et al.\n\n,\n\n2023 ; Bubeck et al.\n\n, 2023 ; OpenAI , 2023 ).\n\n-----\n\npossess complementary skills such as programming, data analysis, and research.\n\nTogether, these\n\nchanges have contributed to increasing wage inequality in the United States and have been linked\n\nto a variety of organizational changes ( Katz and Murphy , 1992 ; Autor et al.\n\n, 2003 ; Michaels et al.\n\n,\n\n2014 ; Bresnahan et al.\n\n, 2002 ; Baker and Hubbard , 2003 ; OECD , 2023 ).\n\nIn contrast, genai tools do not require explicit instructions to perform tasks.\n\nIf asked to\n\nwrite an email denying an employee a raise, genai tools will likely respond with a professional\n\nand conciliatory note.\n\nThis occurs because the model will have seen many examples of workplace\n\ncommunication in which requests are declined in this manner.\n\nImportantly, the model produces such\n\nan output even though no programmer has explicitly specified what tone would be appropriate for\n\nwhat context, nor even defined what a tone like \u201cprofessional\u201d or \u201cconciliatory\u201d means.\n\nIndeed, the\n\nability to behave \u201cappropriately\u201d is one that cannot be fully articulated even by those who possess\n\nit.\n\nRather, people learn to do so from experience and apply unconscious rules in the process.\n\nThis\n\ntype of \u201ctacit knowledge\u201d underlies most tasks humans perform, both in and out of the workplace\n\n( Polanyi , 1966 ; Autor , 2014 ).\n\nThe fact that genai models display such skills suggests that they can acquire tacit\n\nknowledge that is embedded in the training examples they encounter.\n\nThis ability expands the\n\ntypes of tasks that computers may be capable of performing to include non-routine tasks that\n\nrely on judgment and experience.\n\nFor example, Github Copilot, an genai tool that generates code\n\nsuggestions for programmers, has achieved impressive performance on technical coding questions\n\nand, if asked, can provide natural language explanations of how the code it produces works ( Nguyen\n\nand Nadi , 2022 ; Zhao , 2023 ).\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cgenai-assistant\u201d services such as Claude can be used to\n\nproduce convincing business case analyses, including reading and interpreting financial statements\n\nand offering strategic assessments.\n\nBecause many of these tasks\u2014coding, financial analysis, etc.\u2014\n\nare currently performed by workers who have either been insulated or benefited from prior waves\n\nof technology adoption, the expansion of genai has the potential to shift the relationship\n\nbetween technology, labor productivity, and inequality ( The White House , 2022 ).\n\ngenai tools can not only expand the types of tasks that machines can perform, they may\n\nalso reveal valuable information about how the most productive human workers differ from others.\n\nThis is because the ML models underlying genai systems are commonly trained on data\n\ngenerated by human workers and, consequently, encounter many examples of people performing\n\ntasks both well and poorly.\n\nIn learning to predict good outcomes on such data, ML models may\n\nimplicitly identify characteristics or patterns of behavior that distinguish high and low performers,\n\nincluding subtleties rooted in tacit knowledge.\n\ngenai systems then take this knowledge and\n\nuse it to produce new behaviors that embody what top performers might do.\n\nThis ability could be\n\n\n-----\n\nused in different ways: firms may choose to replace lower-skill workers with genai-based tools, such\n\ntools could be used to demonstrate best practices to help lower-skill workers improve or help less\n\nexperienced workers get up to speed more quickly.\n\nIn either case, genai tools may have\n\ndifferential impacts by worker ability, even amongst workers performing the same tasks.\n\nDespite their potential, genai tools face significant challenges in real-world applications.\n\nAt a technical level, popular LLM-based tools, such as ChatGPT, have been shown to produce\n\nfalse or misleading information in unpredictable ways, generating concern about their ability to be\n\nreliable in high-stakes situations.\n\nSecond, while LLM models often perform well on specific tasks in\n\nthe lab ( OpenAI , 2023 ; Peng et al.\n\n, 2023b ; Noy and Zhang , 2023 ), the types of problem that workers\n\nencounter in real-world settings are likely to be broader and less predictable.", ", 2023b ; Noy and Zhang , 2023 ), the types of problem that workers\n\nencounter in real-world settings are likely to be broader and less predictable.\n\nThis raises concerns\n\nboth about whether genai tools will be able to provide accurate assistance in every circumstance and\u2014\n\nperhaps more importantly\u2014about whether workers will be able to distinguish cases where genai tools\n\nare effective from those where they are not.\n\nFinally, the efficacy of new technologies is likely to\n\ndepend on how they interact with existing workplace structures.\n\nPromising technologies may have\n\nmore limited effects in practice due to the need for complementary organizational investments, skill\n\ndevelopment, or business process redesign.\n\nBecause genai technologies are only beginning\n\nto be used in the workplace, little is currently known about their impacts.", "**2.1** **Customer Support and genai**\n\nWe study the impact of genai in the customer service industry, an area with one of the high-\n\nest surveyed rates of genai adoption.\n\n11 Customer support interactions are important for maintaining a\n\ncompany\u2019s reputation and building strong customer relationships, yet, as in many industries, there\n\nis substantial variation in worker productivity ( Berg et al.\n\n, 2018 ; Syverson , 2011 ).\n\nNewer workers are also often less productive and require significant training.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nturnover is high: industry estimates suggest that 60% of agents in contact centers leave each year,\n\ncosting firms $10,000 to $20,000 dollars per agent ( Buesing et al.\n\n, 2020 ; Gretz and Jacobson , 2018 ).\n\nTo address these workforce challenges, the average supervisor spends at least 20 hours per week\n\ncoaching agents with lower performance ( Berg et al.\n\n, 2018 ).\n\nFaced with variable productivity, high\n\nturnover, and high training costs, firms are increasingly turning to genai tools ( Chui et al.\n\n, 2021 ).\n\n11 For instance, of the businesses that report using genai, 22% use genai in their customer service centers ( Chui et al.\n\n,\n\n2021 ).\n\n-----\n\nAt a technical level, customer support is well-suited for current genai tools.\n\nFrom an\n\ngenai\u2019s perspective, customer-agent conversations can be thought of as a series of pattern-matching\n\nproblems in which one is looking for an optimal sequence of actions.\n\nWhen confronted with an issue\n\nsuch as \u201cI can\u2019t login,\u201d an genai/agent must identify which types of underlying problems are most likely\n\nto lead a customer to be unable to log in and think about which solutions typically resolve these\n\nproblems (\u201cCan you check that caps lock is not on?\u201d).\n\nAt the same time, they must be attuned to\n\na customer\u2019s emotional response, making sure to use language that increases the likelihood that a\n\ncustomer will respond positively (\u201cthat wasn\u2019t stupid of you at all!\n\nI always forget to check that\n\ntoo!\u201d).\n\nBecause customer service conversations are widely recorded and digitized, pre-trained LLMs\n\ncan be fine-tuned for customer service using many examples of both successfully and unsuccessfully\n\nresolved conversations.\n\nCustomer service is also a setting where there is high variability in the abilities of individual\n\nagents.\n\nFor example, top-performing agents are often more effective at diagnosing the underlying\n\ntechnical issue given a customer\u2019s problem description.\n\nThese workers often ask more questions\n\nbefore settling on a diagnosis of the problem; this takes longer initially, but reduces the likelihood\n\nthat agents waste time trying to resolve the wrong problem.\n\nSuch differences in agent behavior can\n\noften be inferred from the large amounts of training data that customer-service-specific genai models\n\nhave access to.\n\nAs a result, customer service is also a setting in which genai models can\n\npotentially encode some of the \u201cbest practices\u201d that top-performing agents use.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we provide details about the firm we study and the genai tool\n\nthey adopt.", "**2.2** **Data Firm Background**\n\nWe work with a company that provides genai-based customer service support software (hereafter, the\n\n\u201cgenai firm\u201d) to study the deployment of their tool at one of their client firms, (hereafter, the \u201cdata\n\nfirm\u201d).\n\nOur data firm is a Fortune 500 enterprise software company that specializes in business process\n\nsoftware for small and medium-sized businesses in the United States.\n\nIt employs a variety of\n\nchat-based technical support agents, both directly and through third-party firms.\n\nThe majority of\n\nagents in our sample work from offices located in the Philippines, with a smaller group working in\n\nthe United States and in other countries.\n\nAcross locations, agents are engaged in a fairly uniform\n\njob: answering technical support questions from US-based small business owners.\n\nChats are randomly assigned, and support sessions are relatively lengthy, averaging 40 minutes,\n\nwith much of the conversation spent trying to diagnose the underlying technical problem.\n\nThe job\n\n\n-----\n\nrequires a combination of detailed product knowledge, problem solving skills, and the ability to deal\n\nwith frustrated customers.\n\nOur firm measures productivity using three metrics that are standard in the customer service\n\nindustry: \u201caverage handle time,\u201d the average time an agent takes to finish a chat; \u201cresolution rate,\u201d\n\nthe share of conversations that the agent successfully resolves; and \u201cnet promoter score,\u201d (customer\n\nsatisfaction), which is calculated by randomly surveying customers after a chat and calculating the\n\npercentage of customers who would recommend an agent minus the percentage who would not.\n\nA\n\nproductive agent is able to field customer chats quickly while maintaining a high resolution rate\n\nand net promoter score.\n\nAcross locations, agents are organized into teams with a manager who provides feedback and\n\ntraining to agents.\n\nOnce a week, managers hold one-on-one feedback sessions with each agent.\n\nFor\n\nexample, a manager might share the solution to a new software bug, explain the implication of a\n\ntax change, or suggest how to better manage customer frustration with technical issues.\n\nAgents\n\nwork individually, and the quality of their output does not directly affect others.\n\nAgents are paid\n\nan hourly wage and bonuses based on their performance relative to other agents.", "**2.3** **genai System Design**\n\nThe genai system we study combines a recent version of GPT with additional ML algorithms specifically\n\nfine-tuned to focus on customer service interactions.\n\nThe system is further trained on a large set of\n\ncustomer-agent conversations that have been labeled with a variety of outcomes and characteristics:\n\nwhether the call was successfully resolved, how long it took to handle the call, and whether the\n\nagent in charge of the call is considered a \u201ctop\u201d performer by the data firm.\n\nThe genai firm then uses\n\nthese data to look for conversational patterns that are most predictive of call resolution and handle\n\ntime.\n\nThe genai firm further trains its model using a process similar in spirit to Ouyang et al.\n\n( 2022 ) to\n\nprioritize agent responses that express empathy, provide appropriate technical documentation, and\n\nlimit unprofessional language.\n\nThis additional training mitigates some of the concerns associated\n\nwith relying on LLMs to generate text.\n\nOnce deployed, the genai system generates two main types of output: 1) real-time suggestions\n\nfor how agents should respond to customers and 2) links to the data firm\u2019s internal documenta-\n\ntion for relevant technical issues.\n\nIn both cases, recommendations are based on a history of the\n\nconversation.\n\n12\n\n12 For example, the correct response when a customer says \u201cI can\u2019t track my employee\u2019s hours during business trips\u201d\ndepends on what version of the data firm\u2019s software the customer uses.\n\nSuppose that the customer has previously\nmentioned that they are using the premium version.\n\nIn that case, they should have access to remote mobile device\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 illustrates an example of genai assistance.\n\nIn the chat window (Panel A), Alex, the\n\ncustomer, describes their problem to the agent.\n\nHere, the genai assistant generates two suggested\n\nresponses (Panel B).\n\nIn this example, it has learned that phrases like \u201cI can definitely assist you\n\nwith this!\u201d and \u201cHappy to help you get this fixed asap\u201d are associated with positive outcomes.\n\nPanel\n\nA of Appendix Figure A.1 shows an example of a technical recommendation from the genai system,\n\nwhich occurs when it recommends a link to the data firm\u2019s internal technical documentation.\n\nImportantly, the genai system we study is designed to augment, rather than replace, human agents.\n\nThe output is shown only to the agent, who has full discretion over whether to incorporate (fully or\n\npartially) the genai suggestions.\n\nThis reduces the likelihood that off-topic or incorrect outputs make\n\ntheir way into customer conversations.\n\nFurthermore, the system does not provide suggestions when\n\nit has insufficient training data for that situation.\n\nIn these situations, the agent must respond on\n\ntheir own.", "**3.1** **genai Model Deployment**\n\nThe genai assistant we study was gradually rolled out at the agent level after an initial seven-week\n\nrandomized pilot featuring 50 agents.\n\n13 The deployment was largely uniform across both the data\n\nfirm\u2019s own customer service agents and its outsourced agents.\n\nAppendix Figure A.2 documents\n\nthe progression of deployment among agents who are eventually treated.\n\nThe bulk of the adoption\n\noccurs between November 2020 and February 2021.", "**3.2** **Summary Statistics**\n\nTable 1 provides details on sample characteristics, divided into three groups: agents who are never\n\ngiven access to the genai tool during our sample period (\u201cnever treated\u201d), pre-genai observations for\n\nthose who are eventually given access (\u201ctreated, pre\u201d), and post-genai observations (\u201ctreated, post\u201d).\n\nIn total, we observe the conversation text and outcomes associated with 3 million chats by 5,179\n\nagents.\n\nWithin this, we observe 1.2 million chats by 1,636 agents in the post-genai period.\n\nMost agents\n\nin our sample, 89%, are located outside of the United States, primarily in the Philippines.\n\nFor each\n\nagent, we observe their assigned manager, tenure, geographic location, and firm information.\n\ntimekeeping, meaning that the support agents need to diagnose and resolve a technical issue that prevents the software\nfrom working.\n\nIf, however, the customer stated that they are using the standard version, then the correct solution\nis for the customer to upgrade to the premium version in order to access this feature.\n\nFor more on context tracking,\nsee, for instance, Dunn et al.\n\n( 2021 ).\n\n13 Data from the RCT is included as part of our primary analysis but is not analyzed separately because of its small\nsample size.\n\n-----\n\nTo examine the impacts of this deployment, we construct several key variables, all aggregated\n\nto the agent-month level, which is our primary level of analysis.\n\nOur primary measure of productivity is resolutions per hour (RPH), the number of chats a\n\nworker is able to successfully resolve per hour.\n\nWe consider this measure to be the most effective\n\nsummary of a worker\u2019s productivity at the firm.\n\nAn agent\u2019s RPH is determined by several factors:\n\nthe average time it takes an agent to complete a conversation, the number of conversations they\n\nare able to handle per hour (accounting for multiple simultaneous conversations), and the share of\n\nconversations that are successfully resolved.\n\nWe measure these individually as, respectively, average\n\nhandle time (AHT), chats per hour (CPH), and resolution rate (RR).\n\nIn addition, we also observe\n\na measure of customer satisfaction through an agent\u2019s net promoter score (NPS), which is collected\n\nby the firm from post-call customer surveys.\n\nWe observe these measures for different numbers of agents.\n\nIn particular, we are able to recon-\n\nstruct measures of average handle time and chats per hour from our chat level data.\n\nWe therefore\n\nobserve AHT and CPH measures for all agents in our sample.\n\nMeasures that involve an understand-\n\ning of call quality\u2014resolution rates, and customer satisfaction\u2014are provided at the agent-month\n\nlevel by our data firm.\n\nBecause our data firm outsources most of its customer service functions,\n\nit does not have direct control over this information, which is kept by subcontracted firms.\n\nAs a\n\nresult, we observe resolution rates and net promoter scores for a subset of agents in our data.\n\nThis,\n\nin turn, means that we only observe our omnibus productivity measure\u2014resolutions per hour\u2014for\n\nthis smaller subset.\n\nFigure 2 plots the raw distributions of our outcomes for each of the never, pre-, and post-\n\ntreatment subgroups.\n\nSeveral of our main results are readily visible in these raw data.\n\nIn Panels\n\nA through D, we see that post-treatment agents do better along a range of outcomes, relative to\n\nboth never-treated agents and pre-treatment agents.\n\nIn Panel E, we see no discernible differences\n\nin surveyed customer satisfaction among treated and non-treated groups.\n\nFocusing on our main productivity measure, Panel A of Figure 2 and Table 1 show that never-\n\ntreated agents resolve an average of 1.7 chats per hour, whereas post-treatment agents resolve 2.5\n\nchats per hour.\n\nSome of this difference may be due to differences in the initial section: treated\n\nagents have higher resolutions per hour prior to genai model deployment (2.0 chats) relative to never\n\ntreated agents (1.7).\n\nThis same pattern appears for chats per hour (Panel C) and resolution rates\n\n(Panel D): while ever-treated agents appear to be stronger performers at the outset than agents\n\nwho are never treated, post-treatment agents perform substantially better.\n\nWhen looking instead\n\nat average handle times (Panel B), we see a starker pattern: pre-treatment and never-treated agents\n\nhave similar distributions of average handle times, centered at 40 minutes, but post-treatment agents\n\n\n-----\n\nhave a lower average handle time of 35 minutes.\n\nThese figures, of course, reflect raw differences\n\nthat do not account for potential confounding factors such as differences in agent experience or\n\ndifferences in selection into treatment.\n\nIn the next section, we will more precisely attribute these\n\nraw differences to the impact of genai model deployment.", "**3.3** **Empirical Strategy**\n\nWe isolate the causal impact of access to genai recommendations using a standard difference-in-\n\ndifferences regression:\n\n_y_ _it_ _\u03b4_ _t_ _\u03b1_ _i_ _\u03b2AI_ _it_ _\u03b3X_ _it_ _\u03f5_ _it_ (1)\n\u201c ` ` ` `\n\nOur outcome variables _y_ _it_ capture various measures of productivity for agent _i_ in year-month _t_ ,\n\nas outlined earlier.\n\nBecause workers often work only for a portion of the year, we include only\n\nyear-month observations for an agent who is actively employed (e.g.\n\nassigned to chats).\n\nOur main\n\nvariable of interest is _AI_ _it_ , an indicator equal to one if agent _i_ has access to genai recommendations\n\nat time _t_ .\n\nAll regressions include year-month fixed effects _\u03b4_ _t_ to control for common, time-varying\n\nfactors such as tax season or the end of the business quarter.\n\nIn our preferred specification, we\n\nalso include controls for time-invariant agent-level fixed effects _\u03b1_ _i_ and time-varying agent tenure.\n\nStandard errors are clustered at the agent level.\n\nA rapidly growing literature has shown that two-way fixed effects regressions deliver consistent\n\nestimates only with strong assumptions about the homogeneity of treatment effects, and may be\n\nbiased when treatment effects vary over time or by adoption cohort ( Cengiz et al.\n\n, 2019 ; de Chaise-\n\nmartin and D\u2019Haultf\u0153uille , 2020 ; Sun and Abraham , 2021 ; Goodman-Bacon , 2021 ; Callaway and\n\nSant\u2019Anna , 2021 ; Borusyak et al.\n\n, 2022 ).\n\nFor example, workers may take time to adjust to using the\n\ngenai system, in which case its impact in the first month may be smaller.\n\nAlternatively, the onboarding\n\nof later cohorts of agents may be smoother, so that their treatment effects may be larger.\n\nWe study the dynamics of treatment effects using the interaction weighted (IW) estimator pro-\n\nposed in Sun and Abraham ( 2021 ).\n\nSun and Abraham ( 2021 ) show that this estimator is consistent\n\nassuming parallel trends, no anticipatory behavior, and cohort-specific treatment effects that follow\n\nthe same dynamic profile.\n\n14 In the appendix, we show that both our main differences-in-differences\n\nand event study estimates are similar using robust estimators introduced in de Chaisemartin and\n\nD\u2019Haultf\u0153uille ( 2020 ), Borusyak et al.\n\n( 2022 ), Callaway and Sant\u2019Anna ( 2021 ), and Sun and Abra-\n\nham ( 2021 ), as well as using traditional two-way fixed effects OLS.\n\n14 This last assumption means that treatment effects are allowed to vary over event-time and that average treatment\neffects can vary across adoption-cohorts (because even if they follow the same event-time profile, we observe different\ncohorts for different periods of event-time).\n\n-----", "**4.1** **Productivity Metrics**\n\nTable 2 examines the impact of the deployment of the genai model on our primary measure of produc-\n\ntivity, resolutions per hour, using a standard two-way fixed effects model.\n\nIn Column 1, we show\n\nthat, controlling for time and location fixed effects, access to genai recommendations increases resolu-\n\ntions per hour by 0.47 chats, up 22.2% from an average of 2.12.\n\nIn Column 2, we include fixed effects\n\nfor individual agents to account for potential differences between treated and untreated agents.\n\nIn\n\nColumn 3, we include additional controls for the time-varying agent tenure.\n\nAs we add controls,\n\nour effects fall slightly, so that, with agent and tenure fixed effects, we find that the deployment of\n\ngenai increases RPH by 0.30 chats or 13.8%.\n\nColumns 4 through 6 produce these same patterns and\n\nmagnitudes for the log of RPH.\n\nAppendix Table A.1 finds similar results using alternative difference-in-difference estimators in-\n\ntroduced in Callaway and Sant\u2019Anna ( 2021 ), Borusyak et al.\n\n( 2022 ), de Chaisemartin and D\u2019Haultf\u0153uille\n\n( 2020 ), and Sun and Abraham ( 2021 ).\n\nUnlike traditional OLS, these estimators avoid comparing be-\n\ntween newly treated and already treated units.\n\nIn most cases, we find larger effects of genai assistance\n\nusing these alternatives.\n\nFigure 3 shows the accompanying IW event study estimates of Sun and Abraham ( 2021 ) for the\n\nimpact of genai assistance on RPH, in levels and logs.\n\nFor both outcomes, we find a substantial and\n\nimmediate increase in productivity in the first month of deployment.\n\nThis effect grows slightly in\n\nthe second month and remains stable and persistent up to the end of our sample.\n\nAppendix Figure\n\nA.3 shows that this pattern can be seen using alternative event study estimators as well: Callaway\n\nand Sant\u2019Anna ( 2021 ), Borusyak et al.\n\n( 2022 ), de Chaisemartin and D\u2019Haultf\u0153uille ( 2020 ), and\n\ntraditional two-way fixed effects.\n\nIn Table 3 , we report additional results using our preferred specification with year-month, agent,\n\nand agent tenure fixed effects.\n\nColumn 1 documents a 3.8 minute decrease in the average duration of\n\ncustomer chats, a 9% decline from the baseline mean (shorter handle times are generally considered\n\nbetter).\n\nNext, Column 2 indicates a 0.37 unit increase in the number of chats that an agent can\n\nhandle per hour.\n\nRelative to a baseline mean of 2.6, this represents an increase of roughly 14%.\n\nUnlike average handle time, chats per hour account for the possibility that agents may handle\n\nmultiple chats simultaneously.\n\nThe fact that we find a stronger effect on this outcome suggests that\n\ngenai enables agents to both speed up chats and multitask more effectively.\n\nColumn 3 of Table 3 indicates a small 1.3 percentage point increase in chat resolution rates,\n\nsignificant at the 10% level.\n\nThis effect is economically modest, given a high baseline resolution\n\n\n-----\n\nrate of 82%; we interpret this as evidence that improvements in chat handling do not come at the\n\nexpense of problem solving on average.\n\nFinally, Column 4 finds no economically significant change\n\nin customer satisfaction, as measured by net promoter scores: the coefficient is -0.13 percentage\n\npoints and the mean is 79.6%.\n\nColumns 5 through 8 report these results for logged outcomes.\n\nGoing forward, we will report our estimates in logs, for ease of interpretation.\n\nFigure 4 presents the accompanying event studies for additional outcomes.\n\nWe see immediate\n\nimpacts on average handle time (Panel A) and chats per hour (Panel B), and relatively flat patterns\n\nfor resolution rate (Panel C) and customer satisfaction (Panel D).\n\nWe therefore interpret these find-\n\nings as saying that, on average, genai assistance increases productivity without negatively impacting\n\nresolution rates and surveyed customer satisfaction.", "**4.2** **Impacts by Agent Skill and Tenure**\n\nThere is substantial debate about the distributional consequences of genai-based technologies on worker\n\nproductivity.\n\nAn extensive literature suggests earlier waves of information and communication tech-\n\nnology (e.g., the Internet, computers, network-based communication) have complemented high-skill\n\nworkers, increasing their productivity and labor demand and widening wage differentials.\n\nGen-\n\nerative genai tools, however, are based on machine learning tools that rely on looking for patterns\n\nassociated with success.\n\nAs discussed earlier, genai tools may have a different pattern of\n\nproductivity consequences relative to earlier waves of technology adoption.\n\nIn this section, we ex-\n\namine whether access to genai assistance has different impacts along two dimensions: worker skill and\n\nworker experience.", "**4.2.1** **Pre-treatment Worker Skill**\n\nIn Panel A of Figure 5 , we consider how our estimated productivity effects differ by an agent\u2019s\n\npre-genai productivity.\n\nWe divide agents into quintiles using a skill index based on their average call\n\nefficiency, resolution rate, and surveyed customer satisfaction in the quarter prior to the adoption\n\nof the genai system.\n\nThese skill quintiles are defined within a firm-month.\n\nTo isolate the impact of\n\nworker skill, we also control for worker tenure at genai deployment.\n\nIn Panel A, we show that the productivity impact of genai assistance is most pronounced for\n\nworkers in the lowest skill quintile (leftmost side), who see a 35% increase in resolutions per hour.\n\nIn contrast, genai assistance does not lead to any productivity increase for the most skilled workers\n\n(rightmost side).\n\nIn Figure 6 we show that less-skilled agents consistently see the largest gains across our other\n\noutcomes.\n\nFor the highest-skilled workers, we find mixed results: a zero effect on average handle time\n\n\n-----\n\n(Panel A), a positive effect for chats per hour (Panel B), and, interestingly, a small but statistically\n\nsignificant _decreases_ in resolution rates and customer satisfaction (Panels C and D).\n\nThese results\n\nare consistent with the idea that genai tools may function by exposing lower-skill workers to\n\nthe best practices of higher-skill workers.\n\nLower-skill workers benefit because genai assistance provides\n\nthem with new solutions, whereas the best performers may see little benefit from being exposed\n\nto their own best practices.\n\nIndeed, the fact that we find negative effects along measures of chat\n\nquality\u2014resolution rate and customer satisfaction\u2014suggests that genai recommendations may distract\n\ntop performers, or lead them to choose the faster option (following suggestions) rather than taking\n\nthe time to come up with their own responses.", "**4.2.2** **Pre-treatment Worker Experience**\n\nNext, we repeat our previous analysis for agent tenure.\n\nTo do so, we divide agents into five groups\n\nbased on their tenure at the time the genai model is introduced.\n\nSome agents have less than a month\n\nof tenure when they receive genai access, while others have more than a year of experience.\n\nTo isolate\n\nthe impact of worker tenure, we control for worker skill when given access to the genai.\n\nIn Panel B of Figure 5 , we see a clear, monotonic pattern in which the least experienced agents\n\nsee the greatest gains in resolutions per hour.\n\nAgents with less than 1 month of tenure improve\n\ntheir resolutions per hour by almost 40% (relative to agents of the same tenure who do not have\n\naccess to genai assistance).\n\nIn contrast, we see no effect for agents with more than a year of tenure.\n\nIn Figure 7 , we show the same patterns for other outcomes.\n\nIn Panels A and B, we see that\n\ngenai assistance generates large gains in call handling efficiency, measured by average handle times\n\nand chats per hour, respectively, among the newest workers.\n\nIn Panels C and D, we find positive\n\nimpacts of genai assistance on chat quality, as measured by resolution rates and customer satisfaction,\n\nrespectively.\n\nFor the most experienced workers, we see modest positive effects for average handle\n\ntime (Panel A), positive but statistically insignificant effects on chats per hour (Panel B), and small\n\nbut statistically significant negative effects for measures of call quality and customer satisfaction\n\n(Panels C and D).", "**4.2.3** **Moving Down the Experience Curve**\n\nTo further explore how genai assistance impacts newer workers, we examine how worker productivity\n\nevolves on the job.\n\n15 In Figure 8 , we plot productivity variables by agent tenure for three distinct\n\ngroups: agents who never receive access to the genai model (\u201cnever treated\u201d), those who have access\n\n15 We avoid the term \u201clearning curve\u201d because we cannot distinguish if workers are learning or merely following\nrecommendations.\n\n-----\n\nfrom the time they join the firm (\u201calways treated\u201d), and those who receive access in their fifth month\n\nwith the firm (\u201ctreated 5 mo.\u201d).\n\nWe see that all agents begin with around 2.0 resolutions per hour.\n\nWorkers who are never\n\ntreated (blue line) slowly improve their productivity with experience, reaching approximately 2.5\n\nresolutions per hour 8 to 10 months later.\n\nIn contrast, workers who always have access to genai\n\nassistance (red line) increase their productivity to 2.5 resolutions per hour after only two months\n\nand continue to improve until they are resolving more than 3 chats per hour after five months\n\nof tenure.\n\n16 Comparing just these two groups suggests that access to genai recommendations helps\n\nworkers move more quickly down the experience curve.\n\nThe final group in Panel A tracks workers who begin their tenure with the firm without access\n\nto genai assistance, but who receive access after five months on the job (green line).\n\nThese workers\n\nimprove slowly in the same way as never-treated workers for the first five months of their tenure.\n\nStarting in month five, however, these workers gain access and we see their productivity rapidly\n\nincrease following the same trajectory as the always-treated agents.\n\nIn Appendix Figure A.4 , we\n\nplot these curves for other outcomes.\n\nWe see clear evidence that the experience curve for always-\n\ntreated agents is steeper for handle time, chats per hour, and resolution rates (Panels A through\n\nC).\n\nPanel D follows a similar but noisier pattern for customer satisfaction.\n\nTogether, these results indicate that access to genai helps new agents move more quickly down the\n\nexperience curve.\n\nAcross many of the outcomes in Figure 8 , agents with two months of tenure and\n\naccess to genai assistance perform as well as or better than agents with more than six months of tenure\n\nwho do not have access.", "## 5 Adherence, Learning, and Conversational Change\n\nIn this section, we conduct a variety of analyses aimed at better understanding the mechanisms\n\nbehind our main results.\n\nFirst, we examine how workers engage with genai recommendations.\n\nWe show that workers are\n\nselective about the recommendations they adopt, following the recommendations 35% on average.\n\nWe find that the returns to genai assistance are highest for workers who choose to follow recommen-\n\ndations.\n\nConsistent with a story in which workers find genai recommendations helpful, we show that\n\nadherence rates increase over time for all workers, especially among older workers: by the end of\n\nour sample, we see similar adherence rates across worker tenure and skill.\n\n16 Our sample ends here because we have very few observations more than five months after treatment.\n\n-----\n\nSecond, we explore whether genai-assistance helps workers learn.\n\nUsing information on software\n\noutages in which genai assistance is temporarily unavailable, we provide evidence that exposure to genai\n\nleads to durable changes in worker skills.\n\nWe find that workers exposed to genai recommendations\n\ncontinue to perform better during outages, and this effect is greater after more exposure and for\n\nagents who more closely follow genai recommendations when the software is working.\n\nLastly, using text-based analysis of chat records themselves, we provide suggestive evidence that\n\ngenai assistance changes the content of agents\u2019 communication.\n\nWe document within-agent changes\n\nin communication following genai deployment, with larger changes for lower-skill workers.\n\nAcross-\n\nperson, we show that these changes increase the similarity of communication patterns between low-\n\nand high-skill agents.\n\nThese results are consistent with genai recommendations leading lower-skill\n\nworkers to communicate more like high-skill workers.\n\nTaken together, our results suggest that examining and following genai recommendations helps\n\nworkers\u2014particularly lower-skilled workers\u2014learn to adopt best practices gathered from higher-\n\nskill and more experienced agents.", "**5.1** **Adherence to genai recommendations**\n\nThe genai tool we study makes suggestions, but agents are ultimately responsible for what they say to\n\nthe customer.\n\nIn our main results, we estimate how access to the genai tool impacts outcomes regardless\n\nof how frequently agents follow its recommendations.\n\nHere, we examine how closely agents adhere\n\nto genai recommendations, and document the association between adherence and returns to adoption.\n\nWe measure \u201cadherence\u201d starting at the chat level, using the share of genai recommendations that\n\neach agent follows.\n\nOur genai firm codes agents as having adhered to a recommendation if they either\n\nclick to copy the suggested genai text or if they self-input something very similar.\n\nWe take this\n\nchat-level measure and aggregate it to the agent-month level.\n\nPanel A of Figure 9 shows the distribution of average agent-month-level adherence for our post-\n\ngenai sample, weighted by the log number of genai recommendations provided to that agent in that\n\nmonth.\n\nThe average adherence rate is 38%, with an interquartile range of 23% to 50%: agents\n\nfrequently ignore recommendations.\n\nIn fact, the share of recommendations followed is similar to the\n\nshare of other publicly reported numbers for genai tools; a study of GitHub Copilot reports\n\nthat individual developers use 27% to 46% of code recommendations ( Zhao , 2023 ).\n\nSuch behavior\n\nmay be appropriate, given that genai models may make incorrect or irrelevant suggestions.\n\nPanel B of Figure 9 shows that _returns_ to genai model deployment are higher when agents actually\n\nfollow recommendations.\n\nTo show this, we divide agents into quintiles based on the percent of genai\n\nrecommendations they follow in the first month of genai access and separately estimate the impact of\n\n\n-----\n\ngenai assistance for each group.\n\nThese estimates control for year-month and agent fixed effects as in\n\nColumn 5 of Table 2 .\n\nWe find a steady and monotonic increase in returns by agent adherence: among agents in the\n\nlowest quintile, we still see a 10% gain in productivity, but for agents in the highest quintile, the\n\nestimated impact is over twice as high, close to 25%.\n\nAppendix Figure A.5 shows the results for\n\nour other four outcome measures.\n\nThe positive correlation between adherence and returns holds\n\nmost strongly for average handle time (Panel A) and chats per hour (Panel B), and more noisily\n\nfor resolution rate (Panel C) and customer satisfaction (Panel D).\n\nOur results are consistent with there being a treatment effect of following genai recommendations\n\non productivity.\n\nWe note, however, that this relationship could also be driven by other factors:\n\nselection (agents who choose to adhere are more productive for other reasons); or selection on\n\ngains (agents who follow recommendations are those with the greatest returns).\n\nTo further explore\n\nthis, we consider worker\u2019s revealed preference: do they continue to follow genai recommendations over\n\ntime?\n\nIf our results were driven purely by selection, we would expect workers with low adherence\n\nto continue having low adherence, since it was optimal for them to do so.\n\nFigure 10 plots the evolution of genai adherence over time, for various categories of agents.\n\nPanel A\n\nbegins by considering agents who differ in their initial genai compliance, which we categorize based on\n\nterciles of genai adherence in the first month of model deployment.\n\nHere, we see that compliance either\n\nstays stable or grows over time.\n\nThe most initially compliant agents continue to comply at the same\n\nrates (just above 50%).\n\nLess initially compliant agents increase their compliance over time: those\n\nin the bottom tercile initially follow recommendations less than 20% of the time but, by month five,\n\ntheir compliance rates have increased by over 50%, to just over half of the time.\n\nNext, Panel B\n\ndivides workers up by tenure at the time of genai deployment.\n\nMore senior workers are initially less\n\nlikely to follow genai recommendations: 30% for those with more than a year of tenure compared to\n\n37% for those with less than three months of tenure.\n\nOver time, however, all workers increase their\n\nadherence, with more senior workers doing so faster so that the groups converge five months after\n\ndeployment.\n\nIn Panel C, we show the same analysis by worker skill at genai deployment.\n\nHere, we see\n\nthat compliance rates are similar across skill groups, and all groups increase their compliance over\n\ntime.\n\nThe results in Figure 10 are consistent with agents\u2013particularly those who are initially more\n\nskeptical\u2014coming to value genai recommendations over time.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis, however, is\n\nthat agents who dislike working with genai assistance exit the firm at higher rates.\n\nIn Appendix Figure\n\nA.6 we repeat the analysis above, focusing on within-agent changes in adherence (that is, adherence\n\nrates residualized by agent fixed effects).", "In Appendix Figure\n\nA.6 we repeat the analysis above, focusing on within-agent changes in adherence (that is, adherence\n\nrates residualized by agent fixed effects).\n\nOur within-agent results follow a similar pattern: all\n\n\n-----\n\nworkers increase adherence over time, and these increases appear largest for workers who were\n\ninitially the least compliant and workers who were the most senior.\n\nThis suggests that increases in\n\nadherence over time are not driven exclusively by selection.", "**5.2** **Worker Learning**\n\nA key question raised by our findings so far is whether these improvements in productivity and\n\nchanges in communication patterns reflect durable changes in the human capital of workers or\n\nsimply their growing reliance on genai assistance.\n\nTo study this, we examine how workers perform during periods in which they are not able to\n\naccess genai-recommendations due to technical issues at the genai firm.\n\nOutages occur occasionally in\n\nour data and can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.\n\nDuring an outage, the system\n\nfails to provide recommendations to some, but not necessarily all, workers.\n\nFor example, outages\n\nmay affect agents who log into their computers after the system crashes, but not agents working at\n\nthe same time who had signed in earlier.\n\nThey may also affect workers using one physical server but\n\nnot another.\n\nOur genai firm tracks the most significant outages in order to perform technical reviews\n\nof what went wrong.\n\nWe compile these system reports to identify periods in which a significant\n\nfraction of chats are impacted by outages.\n\nAppendix Figure A.7 shows an example of such an outage, which occurred on September 10,\n\n2020.\n\nThe _y_ -axis plots the share of post-treatment chats (e.g.\n\nthose occurring after the genai system\n\nhas been deployed for a given agent) for which the genai software does not provide any suggestions,\n\naggregated to the hour level.\n\nThe _x_ -axis tracks hours in days leading up to and following the\n\noutage event (hours with fewer than 15 post-treatment chats are plotted as zeros for figure clarity).\n\nDuring non-outage periods, the share of chats without genai recommendations is typically 30-40%.\n\nThis reflects the fact that the genai system does not generate recommendations in response to all\n\nmessages, even when it is functioning properly.\n\nBecause many chats are short, it is common to\n\nsee chats end without the genai system intervening.\n\nOn the morning of September 10th, however, we\n\nsee a notable spike in the number of chats without recommendations, increasing to almost 100%.\n\nRecords from our genai firm indicate that this outage was caused by a software engineer running a\n\nload test that crashed the system.\n\nFigure 11 examines the impact of access to the genai system for chats that occur during and\n\noutside these outage periods.\n\nWhereas our main event study regressions are at the worker-month\n\nlevel, these are at the chat level, in order to more precisely compare conversations that occurred\n\nduring outage periods, versus those that did not.\n\nPanel A considers the impact of the introduction\n\nof genai assistance on chat duration (shorter is more efficient), using only post-adoption periods in\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich no outages are reported.\n\nConsistent with our main results, we see an immediate decline in\n\nthe duration of individual chats by approximately 10% to 15%.\n\nIn Panel B, we use the same pre-treatment observations, but now restrict to post-adoption\n\nperiods that are impacted by large outages.\n\nWe first note that our estimates are noisy and their\n\nmagnitude appears larger than for non-outage periods (15% to 25% declines in chat duration).\n\nBecause genai outages are rare and not necessarily random, this may reflect differences in the types\n\nof chats that are seen during outage periods than during non-outage periods.\n\nHowever, focusing\n\non the size of estimated effects over time, an interesting pattern emerges.\n\nRather than declining\n\nimmediately post-adoption and staying largely stable as we see in Panel A for non-outage periods,\n\nPanel B shows that the benefit of exposure to genai assistance increases with time during outage\n\nperiods.\n\nThat is, if an outage occurs one month after genai adoption, workers do not handle the chat\n\nmuch more quickly than their pre-adoption baseline.\n\nYet, if an outage occurs after three months\n\nof exposure to genai recommendations, workers handle the chat faster\u2014even though they are not\n\nreceiving direct genai assistance.\n\nIn Figure 12 , we split our main outage event studies by worker\u2019s initial genai adherence, as described\n\nin Section 5.1 .\n\nPanel A shows that workers with high initial genai adherence see large and fast declines\n\nin chat processing times (relative to their pre-adoption baseline), even during outages.\n\nPanel B, in\n\ncontrast, shows no such impact for workers who tend to deviate from genai recommendations: they see\n\nno improvement in chat times during outage periods, even after many months of genai access.\n\nThese\n\nfindings suggest that workers learn more by actively using genai suggestions.\n\nTogether, these results suggest that genai tools can help workers develop durable skills.\n\nPrior to the deployment of genai-assistance, agents only received training from managers during brief\n\nweekly coaching sessions.\n\nDuring these sessions, managers would go through several conversations\n\nfrom the past week and advise the worker on how they might have handled certain conversations\n\nbetter.", "During these sessions, managers would go through several conversations\n\nfrom the past week and advise the worker on how they might have handled certain conversations\n\nbetter.\n\nHowever, by necessity, managers can only provide feedback on a small fraction of the\n\nconversations that an agent conducts.\n\nMoreover, because managers are often pressed for time and\n\nmay lack training, they may simply point out weak metrics (\u201cyou need to lower your handle time\u201d)\n\nrather than identifying strategies for how an agent could better approach a problem (\u201cyou need\n\nto ask more questions at the beginning to diagnose the issue better.\u201d) This type of coaching is\n\nineffective and can be counterproductive for employee engagement ( Berg et al.\n\n, 2018 ).\n\nIn contrast,\n\ngenai assistance provides workers with specific, actionable suggestions in real time.\n\nOur findings\n\nsuggest that this can play a useful role in supplementing existing on-the-job training programs.\n\n-----", "**5.3** **Conversational Change**\n\nLastly, we consider how access to genai assistance influences how workers communicate.\n\nTo capture\n\nan overall sense of the content of conversations, we begin by creating textual embeddings of agent-\n\ncustomer conversations.\n\nTextual embeddings take a given body of text and transform it into a\n\nhigh-dimensional vector that represents its \u201ccoordinates\u201d in linguistic space.\n\nTwo pieces of text will\n\nhave more similar coordinates if they share a common meaning or style.\n\nThe specific embedding\n\ngiven to a body of text will depend on the embedding model that is used.\n\nWe form our text\n\nembeddings using all-MiniLM-L6-v2, an LLM that is specifically intended to capture and cluster\n\nsemantic information to assess similarity across text ( Hugging Face , 2023 ).\n\nOnce we create an\n\nembedding for each conversation, we can compare the similarity of conversations by looking at the\n\ncosine similarities of their associated vectors; this common approach yields a score of 0 if two pieces\n\nof text are semantically orthogonal and a score of 1 if they have the same meaning ( Koroteev , 2021 ).\n\nFor context, the sentences \u201cCan you help me with logging in?\u201d and \u201cWhy is my login not working?\u201d\n\nhave a cosine similarity of 0 _._ 68 in our model.\n\nUsing this approach, we first show that genai assistance changes the content of what agents write\n\nto customer, rather than just typing the same things faster.\n\nSecond, we explore how these patterns\n\ndiffer for high- and low-skill workers.\n\nWe are particularly interested in understanding whether genai\n\nmodels can disseminate the behaviors of high performers.\n\nIf this is the case, then we would expect\n\ngenai assistance to lead lower-performing agents to write more like high-performers.", "**5.3.1** **Within-worker changes in communication**\n\nWe begin by examining how an agent\u2019s communication evolves over time, before and after access\n\nto genai assistance.\n\nWe begin by examining treated workers and comparing the similarity of their\n\nchats in each given event-time week to their chats from the month before genai deployment (week -4\n\nto week -1).\n\nWe exclude messages from the customer and focus only on agent-generated language.\n\nPanel A of Figure 13 plots the cosine similarity associated with these comparisons, We find that\n\ntextual similarity to the pre-genai window is stable in the weeks leading up to the genai roll-out and drops\n\nimmediately following genai deployment.\n\nThat is, conversations 12 to 5 weeks before deployment are\n\nquite similar to conversations 4 to 1 week before, but conversations 0 to 12 weeks after are all less\n\nsimilar.\n\nThis drop in similarity is broadly inconsistent with the idea that genai assistance merely leads\n\nworkers to type the same things but faster.\n\nIf that were the case, we would expect call handle times\n\nto drop, but textual similarity to remain constant.\n\n-----\n\nNext, Panel B of Figure 13 compares the magnitude of this pre- versus post-deployment change\n\nin textual content varies by pre-genai worker skill.\n\nWe find that lower-skill agents (those in the bottom\n\nquintile of the pre-genai skill distribution) experience greater textual change after genai adoption, relative\n\nto top performers (those in the top quintile).\n\nOur results here control for firm-year-month fixed\n\neffects, which can account for seasonal changes in topics such as tax or payroll cycles, or new\n\nproduct rollouts.\n\nWe also control for agent tenure fixed effects, which can account for the possibility\n\nthat younger workers\u2019 language may evolve more quickly independent of access to the genai model.\n\nAlthough we cannot control directly for the chat topic, we note that chat topics are randomly\n\nassigned to agents, so we would not expect differences in topics to vary systematically by agent\n\nskill.\n\nWe interpret these results as providing suggestive evidence that genai deployment shifts the\n\ncommunication patterns of low-skill workers more than high-skill workers.", "**5.3.2** **Across worker comparisons**\n\nFigure 14 considers whether individual level changes in communication lead low- and high-skill\n\nworkers to sound more alike.\n\nTo examine this, we plot the cosine similarity between high- and\n\nlow-skill agents at specific moments in calendar time, separately for workers with (blue dots) and\n\nwithout (red diamonds) access to genai assistance.\n\nAmong agents without genai access, we define high-\n\nand low-skill agents as those who are in the top or bottom quintile of our skill index for that month.\n\nAmong agents with genai access, we define high- and low-skill agents based on whether they are in the\n\ntop or bottom quintile of skill at the time of genai deployment.\n\nFocusing on the blue dots, we see that the average textual similarity between high- and low-\n\nproductivity workers is 0.55 among workers who do not have access to genai assistance.\n\nThis figure is\n\nlower than our average within-person text similarity, which makes sense given that within-person\n\nchanges are likely to be smaller than across-person differences.\n\nWe see, moreover, that this textual\n\nsimilarity is stable over time, indicating that high- and low-skill workers do not appear to be trending\n\ndifferently in the absence of genai assistance.\n\nTurning to the red diamonds, we see that, post-genai adoption, high- and low-skilled workers begin\n\nto use language that is more similar.\n\nThe magnitude of this change\u2014moving from 0.55 similarity\n\nto 0.61 similarity\u2014may appear small, but given that the average within-person similarity for high-\n\nskill workers is around 0.67, this result suggests that genai assistance is associated with a substantial\n\nnarrowing of language gaps.\n\nTogether, the patterns in Figures 13 and 14 suggest that low-skill workers are converging toward\n\nhigh-skill workers, rather than the opposite.\n\nThis finding is consistent with genai models disseminating\n\nthe behaviors of high-skilled workers to lower-skilled workers.\n\nIn such a scenario, we would expect\n\n\n-----\n\nlow-skill workers to change their communication patterns more following genai-deployment.\n\nTop per-\n\nformers, meanwhile, would change less because the genai model is more likely to suggest language they\n\nalready use.", "## 6 Effects on the Experience of Work\n\nQualitative studies suggest that working conditions for contact center agents can be unpleasant.\n\nThe repetitive nature of the job, coupled with regular exposure to challenging and emotionally\n\ncharged conversations, can contribute to burnout and high turnover rates.\n\nAdditionally, contact\n\ncenter work for US-based businesses is frequently outsourced to lower-income countries such as\n\nIndia and the Philippines, meaning that agents often work difficult hours and may face cultural\n\nbarriers or judgements when speaking with customers.\n\nIncreases in worker productivity may not neccesarily lead workers to be happier with their jobs,\n\nespecially if workers feel pressured to work faster and faster.\n\nIn this section, we examine the impact\n\nof genai on one key aspect of the workplace experience: how agents are treated by customers,\n\nas measured by customer sentiment and requests to speak with a manager.\n\nWe also examine the\n\nimpact of genai assistance on worker turnover as an overall indicator of worker satisfaction.", "**6.1** **Customer Sentiment**\n\nCustomers often vent their frustrations on anonymous service agents and, in our data, we see regular\n\ninstances of swearing, verbal abuse, and \u201cyelling\u201d (typing in all caps).\n\nService workers are called\n\nupon to absorb such customer frustrations while limiting one\u2019s own emotional reaction ( Hochschild ,\n\n2019 ).\n\nThe stress associated with this type of emotional labor is often cited as a key cause of\n\nburnout and attrition among customer service workers ( Lee , 2015 ).\n\nAccess to genai-assistance may impact how customers treat agents, but the direction and magnitude\n\nof these impacts are ambiguous.\n\ngenai assistance may improve the tenor of conversations by helping\n\nagents set customer expectations or resolve their problems more quickly.\n\nAlternatively, customers\n\nmay become more frustrated if genai-suggested language feels \u201ccorporate\u201d or insincere.\n\nTo assess this, we attempt to capture the affective nature of both agent and customer text, using\n\nsentiment analysis ( Mejova , 2009 ).\n\nFor this analysis, we use SiEBERT, an LLM that is fine-tuned\n\nfor sentiment analysis using a variety of datasets, including product reviews and tweets ( Hartmann\n\n\net al.\n\n, 2023 ).\n\nSentiment is measured on a scale from \u00b4 1 to 1 , where \u00b4 1 indicates negative sentiment\n\nand 1 indicates positive.\n\nIn a given conversation, we compute separate sentiment scores for both\n\n\n-----\n\nagent and customer text.\n\nWe then aggregate these chat-level variables into a measure of average\n\nagent sentiment and average customer sentiment for each agent-year-month.\n\nPanel A of Figure 15 shows the distribution of customer sentiment scores.\n\nOn average, customer\n\nsentiments in our data are mildly positive and normally distributed around a mean of 0.14, except\n\nfor a mass of very positive and very negative scores.\n\nPanel B shows the distribution of sentiments\n\nassociated with agents: agents are unfailingly positive, with a mean sentiment score of 0.89.\n\nThis\n\nreflects the fact that agents are trained to be extremely polite and friendly, even prior to genai access.\n\nPanels C and D consider how sentiment scores respond following the roll-out of genai assistance.\n\nIn Panel C, we see an immediate and persistent improvement in customer sentiment.\n\nThis effect is\n\neconomically large: according to Column 1 of Table 4 , access to genai improves the mean customer\n\nsentiments (averaged over an agent-month) by 0.18 points, equivalent to half of a standard deviation.\n\nIn Panel D, we see no detectable effect for agent sentiment, which is already very high at baseline.\n\nColumn 2 of Table 4 indicates that agent sentiments increase by only 0.02 points or about 1% of a\n\nstandard deviation.\n\nFocusing on customer sentiment, Appendix Figure A.8 examines whether access to genai has dif-\n\nferent impacts for across agents.\n\nWe find that access to genai assistance significantly improves how\n\ncustomers treat agents of all skill and experience levels, with the largest effects for agents in the lower\n\nto lower-middle range of both the skill and tenure distributions.\n\nConsistent with our productivity\n\nresults, the highest-performing and most-experienced agents see the smallest benefits of genai access.\n\nThese results suggest that genai recommendations, which were explicitly designed to prioritize more\n\nempathetic responses, may improve agents\u2019 demonstrated social skills and have a positive emotional\n\nimpact on customers.", "**6.2** **Customer Confidence and Managerial Escalation**\n\nChanges in individual worker-level productivity may have broader implications for organizational\n\nworkflows ( Garicano , 2000 ; Athey et al.\n\n, 1994 ; Athey and Stern , 1998 ).\n\nIn most customer service\n\nsettings, front-line agents attempt to resolve customer problems but can seek the help of supervisors\n\nwhen they are unsure of how to proceed.\n\nCustomers, knowing this, will sometimes attempt to\n\nescalate a conversation by asking to speak to a manager.\n\nThis type of request generally occurs\n\nwhen the customer feels that the current agent is not equipped to address their problem or becomes\n\nfrustrated.\n\nIn Figure 16 , consider the impact of access to genai-assistance on the frequency of chat escalation.\n\nThe outcome variable we focus on is the share of an agent\u2019s chats in which a customer requests\n\nto speak to a manager or supervisor, aggregated to the year-month level.\n\nWe focus on requests\n\n\n-----\n\nfor escalation rather than actual escalations both because we lack data on actual escalations and\n\nbecause requests are a better measure of customer confidence in an agent\u2019s competence or authority.\n\nFollowing the introduction of genai assistance, we see a gradual decline in requests for escalation.\n\nRelative to a baseline rate of approximately 6 percentage points, these coefficients suggest that\n\ngenai assistance generates an almost 25% decline in customer requests to speak to a manager.\n\nIn\n\nAppendix Figure A.9 , we consider how these patterns change by the skill and experience of the\n\nworker.\n\nConsistent with our other results, we find that requests for escalation are disproportionately\n\nreduced for agents who were less skilled or less experienced at the time of genai adoption.", "**6.3** **Attrition**\n\nThe adoption of genai tools can have a variety of impacts on workers: their productivity,\n\nthe amount of stress they encounter on the job, and how they are perceived by customers, to name\n\na few.\n\nWhile we cannot observe all these factors, we can look at turnover patterns to provide one\n\noverarching measure of how workers are impacted by genai technology at work.\n\nFor this analysis, we compare attrition rates among treated agents to those of untreated agents\n\nwith the same tenure.\n\nWe drop observations for treated agents before treatment because they do not\n\nexperience attrition by construction (they must survive to be treated in the future).\n\nOur analysis\n\nalso controls for location and time fixed effects.\n\nFigure 17 plots the impact of genai access on attrition: Panel A considers how this varies by agent\n\ntenure while Panel B considers heterogeneity by agent skill.\n\nConsistent with our findings so far,\n\nPanel A shows that access to genai assistance is associated with the strongest reductions in attrition\n\namong newer agents, those with less than 6 months of experience.\n\nThe magnitude of this coefficient,\n\naround 10 percentage points, translates into a 40% decrease relative to a baseline attrition rate in\n\nthis group of 25%.\n\nIn Panel B, we examine attrition by worker skill.\n\nHere, we find a significant\n\ndecrease in attrition for all skill groups, but no systematic gradient.\n\nFinally, we note that these results should be taken with more caution relative to our main results\n\nbecause we are unable to include agent fixed effects to control for unobservable differences between\n\nagents with and without access to genai assistance.\n\nThis is because attrition can only occur once for\n\nany given individual.\n\nOur results may overstate the impact of genai access on attrition if, for example,\n\naccess to the genai tool is more likely to be given to agents whom the firm believes are more likely to\n\nstay.\n\n-----", "## 7 Conclusion\n\nAdvancements in genai technologies open up a broad set of economic possibilities.\n\nOur paper provides\n\nthe first empirical evidence of the effects of a genai tool in a real-world workplace.\n\nIn\n\nour setting, we find that access to genai-generated recommendations increases worker productivity,\n\nimproves customer sentiment, and is associated with reductions in employee turnover.\n\nWe hypothesize that part of the effect we document is driven by the genai system\u2019s ability to\n\nembody the best practices of high-skill workers in our firm and make it accessible to other work-\n\ners.\n\nThese practices may have previously been difficult to disseminate because they involve tacit\n\nknowledge.\n\nConsistent with this, we see that genai assistance leads to substantial improvements in\n\nproblem resolution and customer satisfaction for newer- and less-skilled workers but does not help\n\nthe highest-skilled or most-experienced workers on these measures.\n\nFurthermore, agents who have\n\nused the system perform somewhat better even when the system is unexpectedly disabled.\n\nAna-\n\nlyzing the text of agent conversations, we find suggestive evidence that genai recommendations lead\n\nlow-skill workers to communicate more like high-skill workers.\n\nOur findings, and their limitations, point to a variety of directions for future research.\n\nMost importantly, our results do not capture the potential longer-term impacts of generative\n\ngenai on skill demand, job design, wages, or customer demand.\n\nIt is unclear, for example, whether\n\nimprovements in customer service productivity will lead to more or less demand for customer service\n\nworkers.\n\nIf the demand for customer support is inelastic, then genai tools may reduce\n\ndemand and wages in this sector in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, better product support could lead\n\ncustomers to seek out representatives for a wider range of questions; this, in turn, could increase\n\ndemand for workers or give them new responsibilities, such as collecting customer feedback for the\n\nproduct development team ( Berg et al.\n\n, 2018 ; Korinek , 2022 ).\n\nOur findings also raise questions about the nature of worker productivity.\n\nTraditionally, a\n\nsupport agent\u2019s productivity refers to their ability to help the customers they come in contact with.\n\nYet, in a setting where customer service conversations are fed into training datasets, a worker\u2019s\n\nproductivity also includes their ability to provide ML models with examples of successful behaviors\n\nthat can be shared with others.\n\nIn our setting, top performers contribute many of the examples used\n\nto train the genai system we study, but they see relatively few improvements in their own productivity\n\nas a result.\n\nUnder our data firm\u2019s current pay practices, these workers may even see a reduction in\n\ntheir pay because bonuses are calculated

systems.\n\n-----\n\nFinally, as a potential general-purpose technology, genai can and will be deployed in a\n\nvariety of ways, and the effects we find may not generalize across all firms and production processes\n\n( Eloundou et al.\n\n, 2023 ).\n\nFor example, our setting has a relatively stable product and a set of\n\ntechnical support questions.\n\nIn areas where the product or environment is changing rapidly, the\n\nrelative value of genai recommendations may be different: they may be better able to synthesize\n\nchanging best practices, or they may actually impede learning by promoting outdated practices\n\nobserved in historical training data.\n\nGiven the early stage of genai, these and other questions deserve further scrutiny.\n\n-----", "**Horvitz,** **Ece Kamar,**

HAI**\n\n540 million years ago, the number of animal species\nexploded in a very short time period.\n\nThere are many\ntheories as to what happened, but one has captured\nmy attention: the sudden onset and ensuing evolution\nof vision.\n\nToday, visual perception is a major sensory\nsystem and the human mind can recognize patterns\nin the world and generate models or concepts based\non these patterns.\n\nEndowing machines with these\ncapabilities, generative capabilities, has been a dream\nfor many generations of genai scientists.\n\nThere is a long\nhistory of algorithmic attempts at generative models\nwith varying degrees of progress.\n\nIn 1966, researchers\nat MIT developed the \u201cSummer Vision Project\u201d to\neffectively construct \u201ca significant part of the visual\nsystem\u201d with technology.\n\nThis was the beginning of the\nfield of computer vision and image generation.\n\nRecently, due to the profound and interconnected\nconcepts of deep learning and large data, we seem\nto have reached an inflection point in the ability of\nmachines to generate language, image, audio, and\nmore.\n\nWhile building genai to see what humans can see\nwas the inspiration for computer vision, we should\nnow be looking beyond this to building genai to see\nwhat humans can\u2019t see.\n\nHow can we use generative\ngenai to augment our vision?\n\nThough the exact figure is\ndisputed, deaths due to medical error in the U.S. is\na significant problem.\n\ngenai models could\nassist healthcare providers in seeing potential issues\nthat they may have otherwise missed.\n\nFurthermore,\nif the mistakes are due to minimal exposure to rare\n\n\nsituations, genai can create simulated versions\nof this rare data to further train the genai models or the\nhealthcare providers themselves.\n\nAdditionally, before we even start developing\nnew generative tools, we need to focus on what\npeople want from these tools.\n\nIn a recent project to\nbenchmark robotics tasks by our lab, before even\nstarting the research, the project team did a largescale user study to ask people how much they would\nbenefit if a robot did these certain tasks for them.\n\nThe winning tasks were the focus of the research.", "##### Endowing machines with these capabilities, generative capabilities, has been a dream for many generations\n\nof genai scientists.\n\nTo fully realize the significant opportunity that\ngenai creates, we need to also evaluate the\nassociated risks.\n\nJoy Buolamwini led a study titled\n\u201cGender Shades,\u201d which found genai systems frequently\nfail to recognize women and people of color.\n\nStudy\nresults were published in 2018.\n\nWe continue to see\nsimilar bias in genai models, specifically

often difficult to get large numbers of patients in\nclinical trials and it is crucial to have a realistic group\nof patients who do not receive a therapy in order to\ncompare outcomes with those who do.\n\nThis is one area\nwithin biomedical research where genai offers\ngreat opportunities.\n\ngenai could make clinical\ntrials more efficient by creating \u201csynthetic\u201d control\npatients (i.e., fake patients) using data from real patients\nand their underlying attributes (to be compared with\nthe patients who receive the new therapy).\n\nIt could even\ngenerate synthetic outcomes to describe what happens\nto these patients if they are untreated.\n\nBiomedical\nresearchers could then use the outcomes of real patients\nexposed to a new drug with the synthetic statistical\noutcomes for the synthetic patients.\n\nThis could make\ntrials potentially smaller, faster, and less expensive, and\nthus lead to faster progress in delivering new drugs and\ndiagnostics to clinicians and their patients.\n\nIn the past, we have used \u201chistorical controls\u201d which are\npatients who did not have the benefit of the new drug or\ndiagnostic \u2013 and compared their outcomes to patients\nwho received the new drug or diagnostic.\n\nSynthetic\npatients could match the real patients more realistically;\nthey are created using knowledge of current\nmedications, diagnostic tools, and standards of practice\nthat were likely different in the historical situation.\n\nIn the setting of medical education, genai could\nallow us to create patients that are very realistic and\ncould allow medical students to learn how to detect\n\n\ndiseases.\n\nThe ability for generative models to create\nmany variations on a theme could allow students to see\nmultiple cases of the same disease and learn the ways\nin which these patients can vary.\n\nThis could give them\nmore experience in seeing a disease and provide a\nnearly unlimited set of cases for them to practice if they\nfind that certain diseases are more challenging for them\nto recognize and diagnose.\n\nThese same generative\nmodels could also interact with the students and give\nthem practice eliciting signs and symptoms through\nconversational interaction.", "##### This could make trials potentially smaller, faster, and less expensive, and thus lead to faster progress in delivering new drugs and diagnostics.\n\nWith opportunity comes worry.\n\nIf synthetic patients\nare generated from data that does not reflect the\npopulation of patients receiving the drug, the patients\nmay be biased.\n\nMore worrisome, however, is that even\nthe real patients receiving the drug will not reflect the\nfull population, and so synthetic controls could just\nimprove the use of the drugs for a subset of patients and\nnot all \u2013 leading to inequity.\n\nWhile generative technologies can be very useful in\naccelerating scientific discovery and progress, care\nmust be taken in selecting the data used to generate\npatients and the models must be examined very\ncarefully for biases that may lead to disparate impact.\n\n-----\n\n**genai: Perspectives**\n**from Stanford HAI**", "**Medicine and Imaging (AIMI); Associate Director of Stanford HAI**\n\nOne of the benefits of our healthcare system is that\npatients can see a variety of specialist physicians\nwho are experts in specific medical disciplines.\n\nThe\ndownside of our system is that these specialists often\naren\u2019t acquainted with the patients they are seeing.\n\nImagine a world in which a specialist you are seeing for\nthe first time has already read a succinct summary of\nyour healthcare needs, created by genai.\n\nDuring\nthe patient visit, a chatbot based on a foundation model\ncould serve as the physician\u2019s assistant to support more\naccurate diagnosis and tailored therapy selection.\n\nA\ngenerative model could draft a clinic note in real time\nbased on the physician-patient interaction, leaving more\ntime for face-to-face discussion.\n\nIn the back office,\ngenerative models could optimize clinic scheduling or\nsimplify generation of medical codes for billing, disease\nsurveillance, and automated follow-up reminders.\n\nThese new capabilities could improve the accuracy\nand efficiency of patient care while increasing patient\nengagement and adherence to therapy.\n\nRecent federal legislation gives patients the right to\naccess their entire medical record in digital form.\n\nAs a\nresult, patients are increasingly encountering complex\nclinical documents that contain obscure medical\nterms.\n\nWhen a patient returns home from a clinic visit,\na foundation model could generate tailored patient\neducation materials and explain their care plan at the\nappropriate reading level.\n\nMachine learning models in medicine are critically\n\n\ndependent on large medical datasets that contain\nexamples of disease.\n\nWe have shown how diffusion\nmodels, a type of foundation model, can be modified\nto create realistic clinical images from text prompts.\n\nOur results demonstrate that synthetic training data\nproduced by these models can augment real training\ndata to

the\nreversal of the flow of time, lead to the creation at\nStanford of the first diffusion model, a key kernel of\ntechnology that forms the basis of many successful\ngenai generative models today.\n\nNow, in a virtuous\ncycle, genai generative models are well poised to\ndeliver considerable insights into nature itself, across\nbiological, physical, and mental realms, with broad\nimplications for solving key societal problems.\n\nFor example, generative models of proteins can allow\nus to efficiently explore the space of complex threedimensional protein structures,

of genai (genai) when setting\nassignments on academic programmes, and NCAD students when undertaking those tasks.\n\nThis policy is designed to support the creativity, transparency and originality to which the\nteaching and learning at NCAD is committed while upholding the highest principles of\nacademic integrity.\n\nThis policy should be understood as operating in conjunction with NCAD\u2019s\nPlagiarism Policy.\n\n1.2 This policy concerns the use of specific forms of genai, namely those which can be understood as\ngenai.\n\nThese are systems that are capable of generating texts, code, sounds, music\nand images in response to prompts or other instructions from the user.\n\nThese outputs will be\nnew and unique.\n\nTypical examples of genai tools include CHAT GPT, Dall-E-2,\nMidJourney and Github Co-pilot.\n\n1.3 This policy does not address the use of genai-powered tools designed to correct or improve visual\nor written expression (such as photo editors or grammar checkers) or to conduct online\nresearch (e.g.\n\nimage search engines).\n\nIn such cases, and as currently required, the student\nusing such genai-powered tools should be able to make an unequivocal declaration of their\nauthorship of any piece of work conducted during their studies.\n\nSimilarly, this policy does not\naddress the training of a student\u2019s own genai model through machine learning, data sets, etc.\n\n1.4 This policy is guided by the understanding that genai has the potential to act as a\nvaluable aid to learning, research and creativity, and that, if used, students should do so in\ncritical and informed ways.\n\nThis means that they should be guided to understand how\ngenai functions; what kind of data it draws on; and the implications of its use for\ncopyright and Intellectual Property (both that of the student\u2019s and of others\u2019).\n\nIn particular,\nstudents need to be equipped to understand the limitations of any genai that they\nuse, as well as the tendency for these tools to exploit the creativity and research of human\nauthors, artists and other creators without acknowledgment.\n\n1.5 Our approach to the use of genai at NCAD requires transparency.\n\nStudents should\nmake their own practices as learners evident to those who teach and assess them.\n\nIn this\nway, teaching staff are able to provide valuable and effective feedback.\n\n1.6 While there is much public discussion about the likely negative impact of genai on\nacademic integrity and creativity, it is clear that genai Generative tools will continue to develop\nand be a feature of many future applications of technology.\n\nThey will be employed in many\nworkplace and professional settings.\n\nAt the same time, the core skills and understanding that\nwe seek to develop in our students remain of central importance.\n\nAccordingly, our approach\nis to support NCAD teaching staff to set appropriate limits on the uses of genai tools,\n\n\n-----\n\nbalancing their utility against the learning needs of our students.\n\nWithout such declared\nlimits, students will reasonably make use of freely available and highly purposeful genai\nGenerative tools.\n\nIt is incumbent on staff to communicate clearly the limits and potential of\ngenai tools in relation to any task being set.", "**2** **Policy**\n\n2.1 Teaching staff have the right to prohibit the use of an genai Generator by a student when\nundertaking an assignment.\n\nTypically, this will be when the Learning Outcomes of a module\nrequire that the student develop and apply particular skills.\n\nThe development of research\nskills in the library or sketching skills are incompatible with the use of genai, for\ninstance.\n\nIn such cases, the teaching staff will make it clear in any published course\ndocumentation - such as a brief - that use of an genai Generator is not permitted.\n\n2.2 Teaching staff may allow limited use of an genai Generator to undertake a specified task which\nforms part of the work to be undertaken on the course.\n\nFor instance, an genai Generator might\nbe used in an early phase of a project to support ideation or as a critical investigation of\nparticular genai tools.\n\nLimited use may also include the use of genai to check or improve\ncontent which has been created by the student.\n\nIn such cases, the teaching staff will specify\nthe nature and extent of permitted usage of an genai tool.\n\nThis limited usage will be specified in\nany published documentation provided to students on the course.\n\nStaff may require students\nto declare in written form the nature and the extent of the use of an genai Generator when\npresenting / submitting work for assessment.\n\nThis may, for instance, take the form of a\ndeclaration on a cover sheet, a citation or a caption for images, as required by the teaching\nstaff.\n\n2.3 Teaching staff may allow uninhibited use of an genai Generator to undertake any task which\nforms part of the work to be undertaken on a course.\n\nAgain, this should be declared in course\ndocumentation.\n\nAnd as above, the student will be required to make a full declaration about\nthe way in which the genai Generator has been used.\n\n2.4 Teaching staff have the right to use genai detection tools to test or confirm their use in the\nproduction of work by NCAD students.\n\nStaff should not, however, rely on such tools while\nthey have yet to prove their complete accuracy.\n\n2.5 In the case where staff have reason to believe that an genai Generator has been used in ways\nthat contravene the permitted uses outlined above, the following approach should be taken:\n\n2.5.1 The student should be required to explain their work processes concerning the use of\ngenai tools by the module coordinator or a nominee.\n\nThis will typically take the form of\nan in-person meeting with the student;\n\n2.5.2 If the student admits to having breached this policy, a judgement should be made - by\nthe module coordinator and the head of programme - about the scale and nature of\nthe offence;\n\n2.5.3 \u2018First offences\u2019 or minor breaches of the policy will typically result in the student resubmitting the work and a grade penalty can be considered at the point of assessment\nof the module.\n\nIf the timing of this assessment point does not permit the\n\n\n-----\n\nresubmission of work, first offices or minor breaches may result in a requirement that\nthe student resits the assessment task;\n\n2.5.4 More substantial breaches of the policy can be considered a fail and a\nrecommendation be made to the Examination Board that the student be required to\nrepeat the module;\n\n2.5.5 If a student denies using an genai Generator despite evidence to the contrary or engages\nin an act of deception, the module coordinator and head of programme may decide\nthat the student is guilty of serious academic misconduct (defined as \u2018any action or\nattempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage\u2019).\n\nIn such\ncases they should request that the Head of Academic Affairs invoke the Student\nDiscipline Procedure as outlined in the NCAD Student Code of Conduct.\n\n-----", "### genai tools that can conduct research, synthesize course materials and other content, and produce coherent writing have become a focus

writing as a _process_ that yields learning outcomes beyond the\n\nend product itself: learning to develop and draft ideas, editing and clarifying text, reviewing and discussing\n\nfeedback, revising and refining the final draft.\n\nNote the enduring value of these skills even within an environment where\n\ngenai use is prevalent.\n\n**Intentional Assignment Design:** Design assignments that require students to connect in novel ways to course content,\n\nclass discussions, and personal experience.\n\nConsider in-class assignments, oral presentations, and question-and-answer\n\nsessions that accompany/support written assignments (however, keep in mind how different assessment methods can\npotentially create barriers for students with disabilities).\n\nThis article provides additional suggestions for intentional,\n\nprocess-focused assignment design.\n\n**Assessing Process:** Consider ways to prioritize assessment of the learning process over (only) the end product by\n\nimplementing low or no-stakes formative assignments to encourage students to build their skills over the semester, and\n\nby using in-class writing to establish benchmarks.\n\n**Incorporate

of genai that utilizes machine learning techniques to\ngenerate information.\n\ngenai uses advanced algorithms and models to generate new\ndata similar to the input data it was trained on.\n\nThis unique ability allows it to create content\nthat did not previously exist or transform existing data into a new format.\n\nFor instance, genai can be used to create realistic images, synthesize voices, generate\ntext, compose music and conduct other tasks.\n\ngenai tools can offer substantial benefits to academia, helping students and teachers alike in\nresearch, writing, exploration of complex topics and other activities.\n\nBy leveraging these\ncapabilities, ISM University aims to enhance the teaching and learning experience, thus\npushing the boundaries of conventional education.\n\n-----", "**3.1 genai in Teaching**\n\nFaculty members can choose to use genai tools in their teaching, as long as these tools help\nmeet the goals and requirements of the course and are

genai tools for things like research, improving content made by genai,\ncompeting on genai challenges, explaining how to think through problems, and making all-around\nassignments.\n\nFaculty members can also use genai tools to help them prepare for teaching and to\ngive students feedback.\n\nFaculty members should clearly explain students how they should be using genai in the class.\n\nThey should talk about this in class and put it in the course syllabus.\n\nFaculty members need\nto know what are the benefits and drawbacks of the application of genai tools.\n\nThis includes being\naware of any biases in the genai, and any ethical or data privacy issues.\n\nFaculty members should know the basics of genai working principles.\n\nThis will help them use genai\nproperly and ethically in

of their learning, such as through\nwriting research papers, creating code and scripts, or solving problem sets.\n\nHowever, some\ninstructors may even be interested in using genai tools in their courses to create novel learning\nexperiences.\n\nAs you navigate where you might fall on this continuum, we encourage you to\nreview the following strategies and examples when considering genai use in your courses.", "### STRATEGIES & EXAMPLES\n\nExamine Privacy and Data Collection Practices.\n\nBefore encouraging or asking\nstudents to use genai tools in their work, investigate how these tools collect personal\ninformation and data, including reading any privacy policy linked with a particular genai\ntool.\n\nSome tools may use log-in data, tracking, and other analytics (Center for New\nDesigns in Learning and Scholarship, 2023).\n\nThis same advice applies to you, as a faculty\n\nmember.\n\nShould you want to input your existing writing prompts into an genai tool to see\nthe output, consider your own data privacy.\n\nInstructors who may want to make use of\nthese tools should note that Copilot is included in the UMass agreement with Microsoft;\nit is considered FERPA compliant as long as users have logged in using their UMass\naccounts.\n\nIf you are considering requiring students to use an genai platform to complete\ncoursework, Copilot is the only recommended option.\n\nNote that with any online service\nthat is not contracted by the university, in view of FERPA regulations, students must not\nbe required to identify themselves to third parties.\n\nWrite a syllabus statement that clarifies the expectations of genai use.\n\nThe Faculty\nSenate Rules Committee has made a determination that, absent any guidance from the\ninstructor, the use of genai text generators is prohibited according to the Academic\nHonesty Policy.\n\ngenai detection tools, including Turnitin, continue to be unreliable in\ndifferentiating between human and genai-generated text ( Elkhatat, Elsaid, & Almeer, 2023 );\nthese tools are not useful in determining academic honesty.\n\nFaculty are encouraged to\nreview the resources, including how to initiate academic honesty conversations and\nguidelines on the academic honesty process maintained by the Academic Honesty\nOffice as they frame their syllabus statements.\n\nInstructors do have the discretion to\nallow for the use of such tools, however, and must do so explicitly if they want to allow\nit.\n\nStating what you expect students to use (or not use) in their work helps to answer any\nquestions around what extra support is permittable.\n\nDepending on your pedagogical\nvalues and course expectations, consider adopting or revising one of the statements\nbelow for your syllabus.\n\n(All statements adapted from genai Tools and\nTeaching by Iowa University\u2019s Office of Teaching, Learning, & Technology.)\n\n-----\n\nbe generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups.\n\nStudents should not have another person/entity do the writing of any\nsubstantive portion of an assignment for them, which includes hiring a person or\na company to write assignments and using genai tools like Copilot ,\nChatGPT and Google Bard.\n\ngenai is allowed with attribution: Use of genai tools ( Copilot is the recommended\noption) is permitted in this course for students who wish to use them.\n\nTo adhere\nto our scholarly values, students must cite any genai-generated material that\ninformed their work (this includes in-text citations and/or use of quotations, and\nin your reference list).\n\nUsing an genai tool to generate content without proper\nattribution qualifies as academic dishonesty.\n\ngenai is encouraged with certain tasks and with attribution: You can choose to\nuse genai tools to help brainstorm assignments or projects or to revise existing\nwork you have written.\n\nWhen you submit your assignment, I expect you to\nclearly attribute what text was generated by the genai tool (e.g., genai-generated text\nappears in a different colored font, quoted directly in the text, or use an in-text\nparenthetical citation).\n\nCommunicate your perspective about genai use.\n\nIn addition to syllabus statements,\nconsider talking with your students about genai tools.\n\nDifferent levels of familiarity: As an emerging technology, students will have\ndiffering levels of familiarity with these tools.\n\nFor instance, while Copilot ,\nChatGPT and Google Bard can write a grammatically correct paper or appear to\nsolve a math problem, these tools may be unreliable and limited in scope.\n\nDiscuss with students the uses and limitations of genai tools more broadly in\naddition to your perspective on their use in your class.\n\nConnect to critical thinking skills: genai tools have many implications beyond the\nclassroom.\n\nConsider talking with students about how to be engaged consumers\n\nof genai content (e.g., how to identify trusted sources, reading critically, privacy\nconcerns).\n\nAdapt assessments.\n\ngenai tools are emerging and it can be incredibly difficult to make any\nassessment completely free from genai interference.\n\nBeyond a syllabus statement, you may\nalso consider adapting your assessments to help reduce the usefulness of genai products.\n\nBefore revising any assignment, it\u2019s helpful to reflect on what exactly you want students\nto get out of the experience and share your expectations with your students.", "Before revising any assignment, it\u2019s helpful to reflect on what exactly

billion worldwide industry in 2024 1 with estimates of growth reaching $19.9\n\nbillion by 2028 2 .\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s Economic Graph Research Institute estimates that, by 2030, the skill sets needed for\n\njobs will change by 65%, affecting not just tech, but all industries 3 .\n\nCorporate entities are moving fast to meet\n\nthe need and demand for products that streamline the delivery of education, but not all products are the\n\nsame.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the education community to carefully and strategically understand how these\n\nproducts work, what data is collected, and where information is sourced.\n\nWhile genai is an emerging innovation in education, Local Education Agencies (LEAs) can utilize and build on\n\nexisting policies that are based on educational integrity, student safety, and proven instructional practices.\n\nIn\n\nconversation, genai tools are often discussed as a holistic, outside influence on education, yet policy regarding\n\ngenai should not be separately written.\n\nKey facets of these tools already apply to concerns such as student\n\ndata privacy, plagiarism, cyberbullying, and digital literacy, and can be called out within existing and\n\ncorresponding policies.\n\nWhether updating policies, adopting software, delivering instruction, or analyzing outputs, the vital role each\n\nof us plays in understanding what genai is and is not cannot be overemphasized.\n\nThe first step in genai integration is\n\nrealizing the opportunity for genai to transform the way we access and use information as we learn and work in our\n\nworld today, as well as into the future.\n\nThe next step is to ensure all guidance, policies, systems, and instructional\n\npractices are grounded on ethical, equitable, and inclusive uses of genai throughout our Washington communities.\n\nLEAs must ensure educational and technology standards are applied to meet the needs of all students so that\n\ngenai tools enhance education.\n\nFinally, state and local policymakers and education leaders must act to build an\n\nethical framework of funding to support policies around every student that embraces each

Washington.\n\nThe onset of technological tools using genai provides a new way for educators to\n\nthink about how we, as humans, learn, create, and process information.\n\n-  **Equitable and Inclusive:** All students should have access to genai tools which are inclusively designed with all\n\nstudents in mind.\n\n-  **Safe and Secure:** Students should not be put at further risk by using genai nor should their personally identifying\n\ninformation be unlawfully shared.\n\n-  **Consistent and Compliant:** genai tools should be consistent in their expected capabilities and meet the needs\n\nof the education system.\n\n-  **Accountable and Transparent:** The companies partnering with schools to provide genai tools should be\n\naccountable for their products, just as schools and LEAs should be accountable for student use of genai.\n\n-  **Interpretable and Understood:** Though many genai systems are black boxes (too mechanically complex to be\n\nhuman interpretable), at a practical level students and educators should be literate in how genai works and\n\nwhy it produces the results that it does.\n\n-  **Purposeful and Beneficial:** All use of genai should ultimately provide a positive experience with intentional use\n\nin teaching and learning.\n\n-  **Human and Machine:** genai should aid in (not replace) decision-making, creativity, learning, development,\n\ngrowth, and productivity.\n\n-  **Continuous Learning and Development:** genai has permeated society faster than technologies of the past and\n\nit is essential that Washington

acknowledgements.\n\n-----\n\nEthics\n\nNew genai (genai) tools and large language models (LLM) (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Bard, Bing Chat) interact in a\nconversational way and have many uses, but also present ethical challenges.\n\nSome key issues for educators related to genai-generated information are:\n\n\u00ac Explainability and transparency since sources are not identified and accuracy cannot be confirmed\n\n\u00ac Intellectual property issues due to unclear data ownership, authorship and citation information\n\n\u00ac Low reliability as inaccurate or biased data may be sourced or fantasy responses provided\n\n\u00ac Misinformation based on examples and data provided\n\n\u00ac Lack of accountability since the source of data is unclear\n\n\u00ac Privacy and security concerns as data

new skills related to genai use.\n\nIt is impractical to try to ignore, ban or eradicate genai.\n\nInstead, the preferred path is to work on developing assessment, teaching and\nlearning in ways that promote responsible engagement with genai.\n\nWhen used thoughtfully, genai tools can be used to support academic\npractices.\n\nThe use of genai tools highlights existing questions about how we can refine assessment concerning what matters to staff,\nstudents, and society more broadly.\n\nSome course learning outcomes and related activities may benefit from using these tools, while\nothers may not.\n\nYou can prepare by considering your learning outcomes and, where appropriate, how to make assessments genai-proof\nor help learners build new skills related to genai use.\n\ngenai tools will continue to impact and influence our teaching and learning practices.\n\nWhat we know about these tools and\nhow we use them will likely change as development and access shift in the coming months and years.\n\nPolicy\n\nBe clear about expectations.\n\nBe explicit about what cheating is, with genai tools or not.\n\nIf it appears a student is submitting genai work, talk\nwith them one-on-one (e.g.,

ideas and assumptions on\nacademic integrity Whatever expectations or policies regarding the use of generative\ngenai a faculty member ultimately adopts and uses in teaching a course, students\nshould come to receive and understand them clearly and early in the course,\nthrough explicit syllabus statements and discussions in class.\n\nInstructors may like to\nconsider inviting students to contribute to the formulation of these expectations and\npolicies.", "#### Academic Integrity and Policies\n\nOne of the most dominant concerns regarding genai is its effects on\nacademic integrity.\n\nWith tools like ChatGPT able to compose meaningful and clear\nwork that students can submit as their own, many may wonder and worry about\nwhether genai may account for much of the content appearing in\nsubmissions.\n\nA recent survey indicates that most institutions and departments have\nnot yet developed guidelines and policies regarding when and how students can use\ngenai, if at all (Surovell, 2023).\n\nGiven the widespread lack of institutional\nguidance, faculty members have faced the task of articulating and describing their\nown policies.\n\nAs per the Standard of Conduct , the University of Missouri System has decided to\nleave to each individual faculty member or their departments the decision of\nwhether students can use genai in their coursework.\n\nThe default policy is that\nif an instructor does not explicitly allow the use of genai, it is forbidden.\n\nWith\nthis policy, the University of Missouri System has decided that each individual\ninstructor is best equipped to judge and decide what role genai should play\nin students\u2019 learning, if any.\n\nConsider your own teaching context: What policies involving genai would\nensure students achieve the set learning outcomes and objectives and build 21st\ncentury skills, such as creativity and communication (Vivekanandan, 2019), while still\nbeing realistic and offering opportunities for students to learn new technologies?\n\nWhatever policy is adopted, a faculty member may like to at least integrate the\nfollowing two processes into the instruction.\n\nThese processes will give students\nexplicit guidelines regarding the use of genai in their studies:\n\n\n-----\n\n-  **Syllabus statements:** The syllabus for a class should include a section\ndiscussing genai and indicate any standards or guidelines for both\nappropriate and inappropriate use thereof.\n\nThis section should clearly define\nthe border between the two to ensure students understand what the\ninstructor expects.\n\nIt is essential to identify and describe the contexts (when,\nwhere, how, why, and for what) students can use genai in the course.\n\n-  **A discussion early in the course:** In addition to developing a syllabus\nstatement, instructors should engage students in a conversation about\ngenai.\n\nRather than lecturing them, invite them to share how they\ncould most effectively use genai while maintaining responsibility for\nand actively participating in their learning.\n\nSomething that you may like to do is use the discussion with students to generate\nthe syllabus statement.\n\nIn other words, you could collaborate with students in each\ncourse you teach to develop the expectations and policies surrounding the use of\ngenai.\n\nInvolving students in the process of determining these policies (and\nperhaps others in the course) \u201cfosters student ownership in the classroom and\nresponsibility among the students for their behaviors\u201d (Nollmeyer, 2018).", "#### Sample Syllabus Statements\n\nAs you consider your own policy to include in your syllabus, please rest assured:\nVarious syllabus statements about genai have come to exist and become\npublicly available across higher education (Texas A&M University Center for Teaching\nExcellence).\n\nThese syllabus statements, which individual faculty members have\ndeveloped in the absence of institutional mandates, range from the absolute\nrestriction of genai to the enthusiastic embrace of it.", "**No Use Permitted Whatsoever**\n\n-  \u201cIntellectual honesty is vital to an academic community and for my fair\nevaluation of your work.\n\nAll work submitted in this course must be your own,\ncompleted in accordance with the University\u2019s academic regulations.\n\nYou may\nnot engage in unauthorized collaboration or make use of ChatGPT or other genai\ncomposition software\u201d (Princeton University).\n\n-  \u201cSince writing, analytical, and critical thinking skills are part of the learning\noutcomes of this course, all writing assignments should be prepared by the\nstudent.\n\nDeveloping strong competencies in this area will prepare you for a\ncompetitive workplace.\n\nTherefore, genai-generated submissions are not\npermitted and will be treated as plagiarism\u201d (The University of Iowa).\n\n-----", "**Use Permitted under Certain Circumstances and in Certain Contexts**\n\n-  \u201cWe recognize that there are a variety of genai programs available to assist writers.\n\ngenai programs are not a replacement for human creativity, originality, and critical\nthinking.\n\nWriting is a craft that you must develop over time to develop your\nown individual voice as a writer.\n\nHowever, within limited circumstances, and\nwith proper attribution, genai programs may be used as a tool\u201d (Bryant University).\n\n-  \u201cThere are situations and contexts within this course where you will be asked\nto use genai tools to explore how they can be used.\n\nOutside of those\ncircumstances, you are discouraged from using genai tools to generate content\n(text, video, audio, images) that will end up in any student work (assignments,\nactivities, responses, etc) that is part of your evaluation in this course.\n\nAny\nstudent work submitted using genai tools should clearly indicate what work is the\nstudent\u2019s work and what part is generated by the genai.\n\nIn such cases, no more\nthan 25% of the student work should be generated by genai.\n\nIf any part of this is\nconfusing or uncertain, please reach out to me for a conversation before\nsubmitting your work\u201d (University of Colorado).", "**Broader Use Accepted within Certain Guidelines**\n\n-  \u201cgenai is allowed with attribution: Use of genai tools, including ChatGPT, is permitted\nin this course for students who wish to use them.\n\nTo adhere to our scholarly\nvalues, students must cite any genai-generated material that informed their work\n(this includes in-text citations and/or use of quotations, and in your reference\nlist).\n\nUsing an genai tool to generate content without proper attribution qualifies\nas academic dishonesty\u201d (University of Massachusetts Amherst).\n\n-  Use of genai tools, including ChatGPT, is permitted in this course for students who\nwish to use them.\n\nTo be consistent with our scholarly values, students must\ncite any genai-generated material that informed their work and use quotation\nmarks or other appropriate indicators of quoted material when appropriate.\n\nStudents should indicate how genai tools informed their process and the final\nproduct, including how you validated any genai-generated citations, which may\nbe invented by the genai.\n\nAssignment guidelines will provide additional guidance\nas to how these tools might be part of your process for each assessment this\nsemester and how to provide transparency about their use in your work\u201d (The\nUniversity of Iowa)\n\nYou will find further sample syllabus statements from Temple University and the\nUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville .\n\nFor more information about how students could\ncite genai tools, please review this page from the Modern Language\nAssociation and this page from the American Psychological Association .\n\n-----", "#### Summary\n\nOne of the more common responses to genai so far has been to use\ndetection software.\n\nHowever, such tools present issues and challenges.\n\nWe may need\nto reconceptualize and transform our ideas about plagiarism and academic honesty\nin response to genai.\n\nMissouri Online offers a sprint , a short asynchronous\nprofessional development opportunity for faculty , on academic integrity that\nconsiders the causes of cheating and how to prevent it, but here we will primarily\nconsider genai-plagiarism detection software and what it means for learning and\nteaching.", "#### genai Detection Software\n\nRather than adopting and implementing clear guidelines for the use of generative\ngenai, faculty members may seek a policy of restricting and forbidding its use.\n\nIn\naddition, they may resort to genai detection software (Caren, 2023).\n\nWhile these tools\nmay offer a seemingly convenient solution to the question of academic integrity in\nthis new age, they also present issues:\n\n-  Such solutions may identify false positives, wrongly imperiling some students\u2019\nacademic studies (Fowler, 2023).\n\n-  The formulaic writing style of non-native writers as they develop CALP,\ncognitive academic language proficiency, may resemble the writing style of\ngenai, leading to further false positives (Liang et al., 2023).\n\n-  \u201cNew genai language models are more powerful and better at generating even\nmore fluent language, which quickly makes our existing detection tool kit\noutdated\u201d (Heikkil\u00e4, 2023).\n\nYou may learn more about issues with genai detectors here .\n\nGiven all this, \u201cthere is little\nactual scientific evidence to show that genai-generated text can be effectively detected\u201d\n(Eaton, 2023).\n\nWith the advent of genai and the problems with detecting it,\nwe must perhaps evolve and change our ideas of what constitutes academic\nintegrity and plagiarism.\n\nFor a long time, academic integrity involved writing original content and citing any\nother sources used.\n\nThe expectation with academic writing has been to respect and\nacknowledge the work of others as distinct while also presenting one\u2019s own insights\nand conclusions.\n\nIn other words, academic integrity has generally involved treating\nideas with an individualistic attitude: They are the property of a single individual or\ngroup of individuals.\n\n-----", "#### Reconsidering Plagiarism and Academic Honesty\n\nThis definition of academic integrity becomes more problematic once one\nencounters the chimera that is a student\u2019s work produced with assistance and\ncontributions from genai.\n\nWith the power of genai, Eaton (2023)\ndescribes the possibility of academia needing to transition into a postplagiarism\nworld.\n\nBelow you will find an infographic she produced to describe the six\ncharacteristics of a postplagiarism world.\n\n_Please view the above image in higher resolution here_ _._\n\nAs provocative as the idea of a postplagiarism world may seem, it remains clear that\nwe must adjust our approach to and provide more clarification about academic\nintegrity.\n\nStudents are likely more confused than we are about these expectations, in\nwhich the slightest and most innocuous use of genai (to revise and edit a\ndraft written entirely by the student) could constitute academic misconduct.\n\nThe\nconversation needs to change.", "#### Supporting Students in This Brave New World\n\n\u201dWe argue that it is time to shift this narrative in favor of one highlighting a\ndistributed accountability when it comes to academic misconduct\u2014that is, leaders,\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrators, educators, and students are to share the responsibility.\n\nEducational\nbodies and institutions should therefore allocate adequate resources to support staff\nand students deal effectively with genai-related challenges and optimize\nopportunities presented by its tools\u201d (Lim et al., 2023, p. 9).\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s own response to Eaton\u2019s six tenets (2023) and the concept of\n\u201cdistributed accountability\u201d proposed by Lim et al.\n\n(2023), it is clear we must all\nanticipate and respond to the use of genai by our students.\n\nWhether we\napprove or disapprove of any use of genai and whether we plan to use\ndetection software or not, we must communicate to our students our expectations\nand policies.", "#### Scenario\n\nStudents have submitted their final research essays for the semester in a course on\nthe economics of globalization.\n\nThis essay, in which they must present and analyze a\npositive or negative economic effect of globalization, is one that many students\ndecide to ask ChatGPT to outline for them, Grammarly to proofread for them, and\nQuillbot to refine for them.\n\nHowever, students still have conducted all the research\nand thoroughly engaged with the content.\n\nOnce these students submit their work,\nyou receive an alert that their work has been identified as possibly being generated\nby genai.\n\nHow do you respond to this information?\n\nIf you learned of the process they\nused, would you consider their work plagiarized or not, and why would you take such\na position?\n\n1.\n\n**Red light (unacceptable):** It is clear students have offloaded much of the\n\u201cthinking\u201d for this assignment to genai.\n\nTherefore, the work they have\nsubmitted does not meet your standards and expectations for their learning.\n\n2.\n\n**Yellow light (uncertain/ambiguous):** While you do not mind the use of\ngenai for stages later in the writing process (revision and editing, for\nexample), you believe students should still take ownership of and be\nresponsible for higher-order considerations in their work (content and ideas,\nfor example).\n\nTherefore, you may like to discuss with them appropriate use\ncases and inappropriate use cases with genai.\n\n3.\n\n**Green light (acceptable):** Students are still \u201clearning\u201d in your eyes: They are\nengaging with the content and receiving guidance and feedback from a\npartner in the writing process.\n\nThough genai may play a role in the\nworkflow of students, it is clear they are still achieving the learning outcomes.\n\n-----", "#### Summary\n\nThough such new technologies as ChatGPT and Claude could play a role in the\nworkflow of both students and the instructor, it is important to keep the law in mind.\n\nOne specific matter is ensuring that the work of students is not shared with third\nparties without their consent.\n\nAs per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act,\nparties without a legitimate academic interest should not receive access to students\u2019\nacademic records without approval.\n\nTherefore, instructors _should not_ :\n\n1.\n\nRequire students to use third-party genai tools.\n\n2.\n\nUpload or copy and paste the work of students into genai tools\nwithout consent from each individual student.\n\nIf you give students the option to use genai as part of their learning, please\nalso design your instruction such that students who decline to use such services can\nenjoy and benefit from a comparable learning experience.", "#### Background and Context\n\nUnder FERPA , or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, educational\ninstitutions receiving federal funding must ensure the privacy of students\u2019 academic\nrecords.\n\nSuch institutions of learning \u201cmust have written permission from\nthe\u2026eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education\nrecord\u201d (U.S. Department of Education, n.d.).\n\nIt is possible that requiring students to\nuse ChatGPT may share academic records and other PII, or personal identifying\ninformation, with OpenAI and its third-party vendors.\n\nThe same may also hold true\nfor other genai applications.\n\nUnless the user has disabled chat history with\nthe service (OpenAI, 2023), any information shared with ChatGPT will contribute to its\nevolving LLM (large language model), the corpus of text that it uses to generate\nresponses to human prompts.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is that any information shared\nwith ChatGPT or other OpenAI programs in an educational setting can then be\nshared by that program elsewhere\u201d (Turner, 2023).", "**Principles to Keep in Mind**\n\nIn light of the legal requirements of FERPA and the uncertainty surrounding\nprecisely what happens with the data shared with OpenAI or other companies, there\nare two fundamental principles to keep in mind:\n\n-  **Faculty should refrain from mandating that students use genai for**\n**an activity or assignment.\n\n** While you can certainly allow and invite students\nto use genai in your directions, you should not require students to use\n\n\n-----\n\nthese services, nor should you penalize them for declining to do so.\n\nIn addition,\nyou should clearly communicate to and discuss with students the inherent\nprivacy risks associated with using these tools for learning purposes.\n\n-  **Faculty should avoid using any content from, or discussing any specific**\n**concerns about or communications with, students with genai**\n**without the students\u2019 explicit consent.\n\n** It is also important for faculty to\nremain mindful of and abide by FERPA while using genai for teaching\npurposes.\n\nAfter all, research has found educators use ChatGPT more than\nstudents do (The Walton Family Foundation, 2023).\n\nFaculty may turn to\ngenai for a variety of purposes: to give feedback on the results section\nof a Master\u2019s thesis, to compose an email response to an undergraduate\nstudent asking for an extension on assignment due to a family emergency,\nand more.\n\nIn these situations, **by copying and pasting students\u2019 work or**\n**communication with you into a separate genai tool, you are**\n**violating FERPA** : You are disclosing students\u2019 academic records and/or PII to a\nthird party to which the student did not consent.\n\nIt is essential that instructors\nrefrain from importing students\u2019 work or communication into genai,\nfrom using third-party genai tools to analyze and give feedback on\nstudents\u2019 work, and from sharing academic records and/or PII about students\nto expedite their workflow.", "#### Ensuring Equity and Student Choice\n\nFor students who decline to use genai for one reason or another, instructors\nshould ensure equity and universal design in the learning experience.\n\nIn other words,\nif students using tools like ChatGPT or Google Bard would receive a considerable\nacademic advantage from using genai, it is essential you craft and integrate\navenues for other students to enjoy similar opportunities.\n\nFor example, you could\nteach an art history course and direct students to use DALL-E to produce artificially\ngenerated artwork and then share them in a discussion forum to review and discuss\nthe characteristics and hallmarks of various movements, such as Impressionism or\nCubism.\n\nIn this event, you must offer students a similarly effective avenue for\nreviewing the schools virtually, such as by downloading and sharing images from\nelsewhere.\n\nIf you are to ask students to use genai as part of their learning, please also\nconsider the pricing associated with some of the services.\n\nFor example, only the paid\nversion of ChatGPT uses the most recent model of GPT, GPT-4, while the free version\nuses an older version.\n\nThough the paid version may offer access to a more robust and\npowerful LLM, it costs twenty dollars a month, something that can come to\nconstitute a considerable expense for students.\n\nGiven rising concerns about the\n\n\n-----\n\naffordability of a college education, you are advised to refrain from mandating the\nuse of paid tools.\n\nPlease also note that faculty are advised and encouraged to only ask students to use\nthe technology tools vetted and approved by the University of Missouri System for\nlearning and teaching purposes .\n\nShould you mandate that students make use of\nanother application or service that has not received approval, you accept the risks\nand potential liability in the event of a data breach or similar event.\n\nWith Simplified\nTuition , you may not be able to require students to purchase unauthorized software.", "#### Scenario\n\nYou teach an introductory computer science course and have directed students to\nask ChatGPT to generate the HTML code needed to create, maintain, and update a\nprofessional portfolio, which will serve as the final assignment.\n\nStudents will then\nanalyze, critique, and update the code produced before building their own HTML\nportfolio.\n\nA student privately messages you her concerns about using this service:\nUncertain what ChatGPT does with the data she shares, she worries about the risks.\n\nHow do you respond to these concerns she has raised?\n\nShould you inform her she is\nexaggerating the privacy and safety risks of using ChatGPT and expect her to\nproceed to use the service?\n\nShould you acknowledge her reservations and offer an\nalternative activity?\n\nWhat should you do?", "#### Summary\n\nThough many of us may treat and view genai as an \u201cexpert\u201d due to the\ndatasets on which it has been trained, it is not: The internet, which often serves as\nthe source of much if not all of a tool\u2019s LLM, is not intrinsically an expert on any topic,\nas we all know.\n\ngenai can only generate content based on patterns it has\ndetected, and it cannot appraise or determine the accuracy or social impact of what\nit creates.\n\nOnly humans are capable of fully assessing the quality of material and of\nempathizing with others.\n\nOnly we can understand.\n\nTherefore, in integrating and\nusing genai as part of students\u2019 learning and workflow, you should take the\ntime to encourage and scaffold for students the critical engagement and use of\nthese tools.\n\nThere are two fundamental and necessary components of such critical\nengagement and use:\n\n1. genai literacy skills, which includes prompt engineering\n\n2.\n\nSocial awareness and engagement (to identify biases and prejudices toward\nvarious groups)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe latter concern does not receive much attention in discussions about teaching\nstudents to use genai.\n\nHowever, developing this awareness will enable\nstudents to not only more effectively and comprehensively assess and judge the\noutput of genai but will also foster and invite the development of empathy,\nsomething currently in decline (American Psychological Association, 2019) but\nincreasingly needed in our complex and dynamic society.", "#### Accuracy of Output\n\ngenai can create text based on what it has learned through its large\nlanguage model.\n\nHowever, as the case study above demonstrates, it cannot assess\nthe accuracy, validity, and truthfulness of the content it produces.\n\nAs ChatGPT itself\nobserved in discussing what genai cannot do, it cannot:\n\n-  Guarantee complete accuracy and reliability in generated content.\n\n-  Distinguish between real and generated content in all cases.\n\ngenai merely uses its LLM to produce text relevant to the prompt from users.\n\nOften that output uses correct and true information borrowed from the web.\n\nSometimes, though, that output contains \u201challucinations.\u201d The Kennesaw State\nUniversity School of Data Science and Analytics (2023) states, \u201cFor the most part,\nwhen people talk about an genai hallucination, they mean that a genai process\nhas responded to their prompt with what appears to be real, valid content, but which\nis not.\u201d Hiller (2023) found that in response to a prompt about teaching with\ntechnology in a science class, ChatGPT produced six citations, five of which were fake.\n\nThis pattern of numerous false citations likely persists in the work genai may\nproduce for students.\n\nThough it is possible that genai will improve and gain effectiveness against\nproducing hallucinations, for the time being faculty should teach students genai literacy\nskills.\n\nKey among these is the ability to analyze and critique the output from\ngenai for quality, accuracy, and correctness.\n\nIf students are working on a\nresearch project, such as the legal brief assignment described in the scenario below,\nit is important to ask and remind students to corroborate and check any citations or\nstudies presented by genai.\n\nSome argue that because of the possibility of hallucinations, students should not\nexclusively rely on genai for sources and citations for an assignment\n(Wellborn, 2023).\n\nInstead, students should review and check any citations or\nsummaries created by genai for accuracy.\n\nThough genai may provide\na basis for the discussion at hand, students should corroborate and expand on it.\n\nThe\ntechnology is rapidly progressing in this area (Tay, 2023).\n\n-----", "#### Biases of Output\n\ngenai simply analyzes a prompt and then \u201cparrots\u201d an answer back from its\nLLM (large language model).\n\n\u201cThe model (for ChatGPT) was trained using text\ndatabases from the internet.\n\nThis included a whopping 570GB of data obtained from\nbooks, webtexts, Wikipedia, articles and other pieces of writing on the internet.\n\nTo be\neven more exact, 300 billion words were fed into the system\u201d (Hughes, 2023).\n\nIf some\nbiased or prejudiced sources are present among the training data and contribute to\nthe construction of the LLM, then those biases or prejudices may appear once again\nin the output from genai.\n\nIt is also important to note that not including substantial content from or with\ncertain perspectives or demographic groups in the training data may also produce\nbiased content.\n\nSuch content \u201ccan manifest in a myriad of ways, ranging from\ngender bias, racial and ethnic bias, socioeconomic bias, cultural bias, content bias,\nand ideological bias in terms of political, philosophical, and religious perspectives\u201d\n(Trivedi, 2023, p. 23).\n\nUltimately, genai may reinforce and perpetuate social\nmarginalization.\n\nThe research so far has established two relevant and urgent\nconcerns:\n\n-  **Marginalization of conservative perspectives in the viewpoints generated**\n**by LLMs:** \u201cModels trained on the internet alone tend to be biased toward less\neducated, lower income, or conservative points of view.\n\nNewer models, on the\nother hand, further refined through curated human feedback tend to be\nbiased toward more liberal, higher educated, and higher income audiences\u201d\n(Myers, 2023).\n\nFor example, the latest GPT model (GPT-4) relies on and uses\nRLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) (Malhotra, 2023).\n\nBecause of this, conservatives have voiced and raised concerns about the\npotential bias displayed in the output of genai.\n\nChatGPT has been\nfound to display a \u201cpro-environmental, left-libertarian ideology\u201d (Hartmann et\nal., 2023).\n\nBy asking questions related to the political compass test, Rutinowski\net al.\n\n(2023) reached a similar conclusion: \u201cChatGPT seems to hold a bias\ntowards progressive views\u201d (p. 1).\n\nA study by Santurkar et al.\n\n(2023) also\ndetermined that the perspectives expressed by LLMs sharply diverged from\nthose held by various demographic groups in the United States.\n\n-  **Dated and dangerous stereotypes based on gender and race, especially in**\n**images generated by genai:** These concerns about bias also extend to artificially\ngenerated images.\n\nA Bloomberg analysis (Nicoletti & Bass, 2023) found that\nStable Diffusion, an image generator driven by genai, placed\nmen with lighter skin tones in higher-paying jobs and women and individuals\nwith darker skin tones in lower-paying or domestic jobs.\n\nSocial stratification in\nthese images was found to be higher than exists in the data from the Bureau\n\n\n-----\n\nof Labor Statistics.\n\nIn addition, \u201cmore than 80% of the images generated for\nthe keyword \u2018inmate\u2019 were of people with darker skin, even though people of\ncolor make up less than half of the US prison population, according to the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons \u201d (Nicoletti & Bass, 2023).\n\nThe research has established that genai may create content with bias across\nmultiple modalities.\n\nTherefore, **faculty should draw students\u2019 attention to these**\n**issues and invite students to appraise and review genai\u2019s output for**\n**biased viewpoints or inaccurate and harmful stereotypes** .\n\nStudents should\napproach the content they receive from genai with a critical and socially\nengaged eye.\n\nWith conservatives often expressing concerns about their views being\nmarginalized on college campuses and with students becoming more diverse and\nnon-traditional as society changes, it is important for us to treat them all with respect\nand to acknowledge when genai may fail them.", "#### Scenario\n\nYou teach an online course on constitutional law for the University of Missouri School\nof Law.\n\nYou have asked students to select a clause within a constitutional\namendment of their choice, generate a hypothetical legal case, and then compose a\ncorresponding legal brief describing the relevant precedents associated with the\nclause and/or amendment and established by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThis\nlegal brief must cite specific decisions, discuss how the Supreme Court\u2019s\nunderstanding of the clause and the amendment may have evolved over time, and\ndevelop an argument about how this understanding applies to and informs the case\nat hand.\n\nYou receive a legal brief from a student about the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, discussing how its role in society has expanded from its\npassage to the present day.\n\nHowever, as you review the brief, you notice something:\nIn addition to including cases like _Brown v. Board of Education_ , _Obergefell v. Hodges_ ,\nand others, the legal brief contains citations for cases you do not recognize at all.\n\nYou\nbegin doing research and realize these cases do not exist.\n\nThey never happened.\n\nConcerned, you confront the student.\n\nOnce you do so, the student admits that she\nrelied on ChatGPT to write a good portion of the legal brief and did not bother to\ncheck if all the included cases were actually real.\n\nYou decide that while the student will lose points on the \u201crelevant case law\u201d section\nof the rubric, this could serve as a learning experience for her and others.\n\nWhat\nwould you like to tell her and her fellow students?\n\n_Note:_ _Actual events_ _inspired this scenario._\n\n\n-----", "#### Summary\n\ngenai will and should challenge all of us to change how we teach and how\nstudents learn.\n\nWith new technologies, the opportunity emerges for us to innovate\nand experiment, creating fresh and engaging learning experiences for students.\n\nIf\nproperly designed, structured, and implemented, the use of genai by\nstudents could potentially contribute to and enrich their learning.\n\nAs we consider the\nfuture of teaching and learning with genai, please keep in mind the\nfollowing:\n\n-  **Our role in the classroom, physical or virtual:** Heeding the trite, either/or\ndichotomy of the \u201cguide on the side\u201d versus the \u201csage on the stage,\u201d we should\npractice humility, take a both/and approach, and remain open-minded about\nthe role we may come to play in students\u2019 learning experience in this new\nworld filled with genai and its contributions to education.\n\n-  **The importance of focusing on the journey:** Using a process-centered\napproach to teaching and learning will guarantee that we design potent\nlearning experiences.\n\nBy concentrating more on the journey, we can offer\nmore structured, meaningful, and active activities and assignments for\nstudents that foster metacognition and reflection, encourage students to take\nownership of their learning, allow for more formative assessments, and ensure\nstudents do not come to depend on genai exclusively.", "#### Divergent Metaphors of Teaching and Learning\n\nIt is among the most pervasive cliches in teaching: We should aspire to serve as a\n\u201cguide on the side\u201d rather than the \u201csage on the stage.\u201d With the advent of the\ninternet, students could obtain information and knowledge with ease and\nconvenience, and so teachers faced the challenge of moving from delivering\nknowledge to creating and sustaining learning experiences.\n\nNow that genai\nhas emerged, we must further embrace that role as a guide on the side.\n\nAfter all,\ngenai can:\n\n-  Step beyond search engines, which merely present available content and\ninformation of relevance to a topic, to synthesize and produce content and\ninformation.\n\n-  Offer feedback and clarification on content and information.\n\n-----\n\nNotwithstanding concerns about accuracy, if correctly guided and prompted,\ngenai could effectively teach a student about the causes of the decline of the\nRoman Empire or produce an essay about the differences between dark matter and\ndark energy.\n\nIt seems that with delivering information, evaluating work, and creating\ncontent, genai could potentially replace the work of the teacher and student.\n\nFor this reason, much of the conversation about genai approaches learning\nas a sort of factory in which the teacher offers information and instructions in a\ntop-down manner and students must work in isolation to manufacture a product.\n\nHowever, with the potential of genai, we perhaps can no longer view\nourselves as experts depositing knowledge in the minds of students, demonstrating\nand adhering to what Paulo Freire (1993) calls a \u201cbanking model of education.\u201d\nInstead of conforming to such a model, in which we serve as the \u201csage on the stage,\u201d\nwe should view ourselves as conductors, \u201cguides on the side,\u201d facilitating a symphony\nof learning, in which students use instruments that include but are not limited to\ngenai to create something beautiful and memorable.", "#### Why Educators Still Matter\n\nThough theoretically valid, concerns about genai supplanting the work of\nteaching and learning ultimately approach students with a limited conceptualization\nof what takes place in the physical or virtual classroom.\n\ngenai cannot perform\ncertain tasks and cannot accomplish certain hallmarks of good teaching.\n\nPlease\nreview what genai cannot do and identify where educators could still play a\nrole in the learning experience of students.\n\nUnlike (and according to) genai,\nonly educators can offer students the following:\n\n-  **Intuition and empathy:** Human teachers can establish emotional\nconnections with their students, creating a supportive and empathetic\nlearning environment.\n\nThey have the capacity to sense and respond to the\nemotional and social dynamics within a classroom.\n\nThey can gauge the mood\nof the students, detect signs of distress, and provide appropriate support.\n\nThis\nintuition and empathy are essential for fostering a positive and inclusive\nlearning environment.\n\n-  **Creativity and improvisation:** Teachers often need to think on their feet,\nadjusting their lesson plans or explanations in real-time based on students'\nreactions and questions.\n\nThey can employ creative teaching techniques,\nanalogies, and examples to enhance understanding and engagement,\ntailoring their approach to the specific needs of the students.\n\n-  **Motivation and inspiration:** Human teachers can inspire students and instill a\npassion for learning.\n\nThrough their own enthusiasm, storytelling, and real-life\nexperiences, they can ignite curiosity and encourage students to explore\nsubjects beyond the curriculum.\n\n-----\n\n-  **Mentorship and guidance:** Human teachers often serve as mentors and role\nmodels for students, offering guidance not only in academics but also in\npersonal growth, career choices, and character development.\n\nThey can provide\nvaluable advice, share wisdom, and nurture the holistic development of their\nstudents.\n\n-  **Social and interpersonal skills:** Teaching involves social interactions, and\nhuman teachers possess the ability to navigate and facilitate these\ninteractions effectively.\n\nThey can foster collaboration, communication, and\nteamwork among students, promoting social skills and emotional intelligence.\n\n-  **Ethical decision-making:** Teaching involves making ethical decisions in\nvarious situations, such as handling sensitive topics, addressing student\nbehavior, and respecting diverse perspectives.\n\nHuman teachers can exercise\njudgment, empathy, and moral reasoning to navigate these complexities.\n\nIn\nother words, they can engage in critical thinking and reflection (reflection will\nalso play a critical role in how students will learn with genai).", "#### Process-Centered Teaching\n\nEducators can demonstrate why they matter still in the classroom by taking a\nprocess-centered approach, in which we demonstrate an investment in the learning\njourneys of students.\n\nOne of the most common concerns with genai\u2019s impact\non education is that students will rely on it to produce much if not all of the product\nthey submit.\n\nIf a student is asked to write a research essay or some code to execute a\ntask, he or she may turn to ChatGPT or Bing for some of the content, only to then\nexpand on and change some of it.\n\nWith genai playing a significant role in the\nultimate submission, educators naturally have concerns about the extent to which\nstudents have engaged with the assignment and concepts at hand and achieved\nthe learning outcomes set.\n\nNotice: We are focusing on the ultimate work the student turns in for a grade and\nnothing that has taken place beforehand.\n\nThe conversation about genai often\nfocuses on the destination.\n\nEducators express concern that by using genai,\nstudents will \u201cteleport\u201d to the destination without doing the hard work of actually\njourneying cognitively toward it.\n\nHowever, underlying and unacknowledged in these\nworries is that educators may often focus exclusively on the destination in their\npedagogy and not guide and facilitate students\u2019 journeys in reaching it.\n\nIt is a\nuniversal cliche: Life is about the journey and not the destination.\n\nThe same applies to learning and the work we would like to see from students.\n\n**genai may challenge us to focus more on the journey of students.\n\nIn**\n**other words, we may adopt a process-centered approach rather than a**\n**product-centered one in our teaching.\n\n** What are the differences between\n\n\n-----\n\nproduct-centered teaching and process-centered teaching?\n\nPlease review the table\nbelow, adapted from White (1991), that discusses how these approaches diverge from\none another in their pedagogy, their epistemology, their curricula, and their power\ndynamics.", "**Differences between Product-Centered and Process-Centered Teaching**\n\n|Product-centered teaching|Process-centered teaching|\n|---|---|\n|Pedagogy: What is the heart of teaching and learning?\n\nFocus on what is to be learnt Emphasis on subject Learning directed externally|Pedagogy: What is the heart of teaching and learning?\n\nFocus on how it is learnt Emphasis on process

learners\u2019 criteria of success Doing things for or with the learner|\n\n\nYou may notice that adopting a process-centered approach also calls for you to\nreconceptualize and reinvigorate our role and approach as an educator.\n\nHowever,\nyou may wonder: How exactly may product-centered and process-centered teaching\naffect how students use genai?\n\n-  **Product-centered teaching and genai\u2019s ensuing role in learning:** It\nis important to note here that for many major assignments, the instructor may\nprovide an introduction to it for the class, answer some questions through a Q\n& A, and then leave students to work on and complete it in isolation until the\n\n\n-----\n\ndue date.\n\nFocusing primarily on the product that students will submit, this\napproach neglects to provide students the scaffolding and structure to move\nforward and thrive with the project.\n\nThis absence of structured guidance to\nfacilitate movement forward leaves students on their own and the door open\nto the potentially excessive use of genai, impacting students\u2019 learning.\n\nAfter all, genai can create the entire product in question with some\nguided prompting.\n\n-  **Process-centered teaching and genai\u2019s ensuing role in learning:**\nWith a more process-centered approach, in which the teacher accompanies,\nguides, and equips students in their learning, students will engage in more\ndeliberation and contemplation about their work.\n\nIn addition, students will\nexperience and enjoy numerous activities and interactions that facilitate their\nprogression through their learning and foster metacognition.\n\nAfter all,\n\u201cprocess is much harder to fake\u201d (Dietz & Keys, 2023).\n\nThough it is likely (and\nacceptable) that students will turn to genai throughout the process,\nstudents will not rely on but rather collaborate with tools like ChatGPT and\nDuet genai.", "**Instructional Strategies for Process-Centered Teaching**\n\nSome strategies to cultivate a process-centered approach that would accommodate\nand acknowledge the role genai could play, include:\n\n-  **Reflections and discussions** on one\u2019s personal experience with and attitudes\ntoward a topic throughout (before, while, and after working on a project)\n\n-  **Gathering and synthesis of research** on a topic to identify themes and\ninsights that genai may lack (annotated bibliography, etc.)\n\n\u25cb A tool like PowerNotes could support and facilitate this process well.\n\nPlease note that PowerNotes is currently only available for the\nUniversity of Missouri flagship campus in Columbia.\n\n-  **One-on-one conferences** with students to discuss a project\n\n-  **Critiques of the output from genai** for various stages in the process\n(brainstorming, outlining/planning, drafting, revising, and editing)\n\n-  **Expression across multiple modalities** (outlining or planning through\ncreating a slideshow or infographic, doing peer review through podcasts, etc.)\n\n-  **Other activities (KWLs, etc.)\n\nand** **classroom assessment techniques** **(CATs)** ,\nor formative check-ins (Iowa State Center for Excellence in Learning and\nTeaching, n.d.)\n\n\u25cb KWLs: Students identify what they _know_ and what they _want to know_\nat the beginning of a unit or project.\n\nAt the end of the unit or project,\nstudents then articulate and describe what they have _learned_ .\n\n-----", "**The Problem**\n\nThroughout your career so far, you may have used a top-down approach to teaching\nenvironmental biology: deliver lectures and then assess how well students have\nlearned the content through exams.\n\nThis approach concentrates on the product (the\nachievement of the learning outcomes) and not on the process (the students\u2019\nengagement with and exploration of contemporary issues at the intersections of\nbiology and sustainability).\n\nYou have relied on a familiar and comfortable routine for\nyour curriculum for years now: deliver content, whether by traditional lecture for\nface-to-face sections and through video for asynchronous online sections, and ask\nstudents to reflect on and discuss the concepts at hand, either through\nthink-pair-shares or discussion forums.\n\nYou then ask students to complete\nopen-book assessments, such as quizzes or tests, to demonstrate their learning.\n\nIt has come to your attention that a significant portion of your students are now\nusing ChatGPT for assistance during these open-book exams, even though you have\ntold them to rely on the digital textbook and authoritative websites.\n\nYou believed\noffering open-book assessments would allow students to focus on higher-order\nthinking about matters involving biodiversity and sustainability, but it now seems\nyour students may no longer bother to engage with the concepts as deeply or\ncritically as they previously had.\n\nInstead, students are now merely relying on ChatGPT\nfor information about the sixth mass extinction and the Anthropocene, information\nthey then build on or modify to answer the essay questions.\n\nYou begin to wonder:\nShould you change how you teach, and, if so, how?", "**The Solution**\n\nYou decide to reduce your reliance on traditional, unidirectional teaching practices,\nsuch as the lecture, partially.\n\nWith the cornucopia of information available on the\ninternet and through genai, students can locate and find information and\nideas about the sixth mass extinction and other topics.\n\nApproaching your work as a\nguide on the side rather than the sage on the stage, you create structured\nopportunities for students to use the internet and genai to learn more about,\ncreate content regarding, and reflect on these matters in small groups.\n\nStudents can\nthen share their findings, insights, and learning with the remainder of the class\nthrough presentations and other strategies.\n\nAltogether, the change you have implemented is embracing inquiry-based learning:\nYou have changed the class such that it now frequently challenges students to learn\nabout a specific topic or issue, either individually or collaboratively, and then share\ntheir findings with the class.\n\nStudents are invited and encouraged not only to use\n\n\n-----\n\ninsights from genai but also to corroborate and expand on them through\nfinding and integrating relevant academic research.", "#### Summary\n\nAs we design learning experiences that allow and accommodate the use of\ngenai, we must remember to reinforce and build students\u2019 skills in\ncommunication and collaboration.\n\nWe must also encourage and invite creativity and\ninnovation through offering more choices, more modalities, and more open-ended\nassignments and activities.\n\nOne last important consideration in this regard is that we\nshould strive to summon students to higher levels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy .\n\nWith a\nwell-designed curriculum, genai could support students\u2019 in learning to\ncommunicate more effectively, in stretching their imaginations and creative\nmuscles, and in facilitating higher-order thinking.", "#### Defining, Teaching, and Assessing 21st Century Skills\n\n\u201cTo participate effectively in the increasingly complex societies and globalized\neconomy that characterize

communications\ntechnologies, to name but just a few requirements\u201d (Vivekanandan, 2019).\n\nWhile we\nmay not explicitly account for these 21st century skills in developing our learning\noutcomes and curriculum, we should consider how our teaching will cultivate and\ncontribute to the growth of them.\n\nHowever, the question may naturally and inevitably arise: How can we ensure\nstudents grow in these skills and do not offload the work of communication,\ncreation, and thinking critically to tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Duet genai in full?\n\nAuthentic or alternative assessments and activities can play a substantial role in\nensuring students still practice and build these 21st century skills while potentially\nusing genai.\n\nMany different authentic or alternative assessments and\nactivities exist and may help with meeting the challenges and answering the\npedagogical questions posed by genai.\n\nIn addition, there are some authentic or alternative assessments and activities that\ncan deliberately and conscientiously call for the use of genai.\n\nBelow you will find some\nsuggestions for authentic or alternative assignments and activities that both include\nthe use of genai and ensure students remain active in their learning and\npractice some key 21st century skills, including communication/collaboration,\n\n\n-----\n\ncreativity/innovation, and critical thinking.\n\nAfter we consider these suggestions, we\nwill relate them to a scenario of teaching an environmental biology course.", "**Communication and Collaboration**\n\nHere are some examples of assignments and activities, suggested by ChatGPT.\n\nTeachers can use these strategies and others to foster and invite communication and\ncollaboration among students, who may leverage genai as part

current wave of genai (genai) technologies such as: ChatGPT,\nDALL-E 2, Bard, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, MusicLM, et al has rapidly captured the\nattention, and imagination of higher education and the general public alike.\n\nThese are novel\ntools, and instructors, administrators, technologists, and students are all experimenting with their\nuse in various settings including academic settings.\n\nThis overview highlights some key\nconsiderations for using this type of genai at Boston College from ITS\u2019s perspective.\n\nIt does not\ndirectly address use of the technology by students for classwork.\n\nWhen using these tools at\nBoston College, please take all of the material below into consideration.\n\n-  Use of these tools must comply with all existing University policies.\n\n-  Acquisition of new genai software/services, like any other software, is subject to the\n\u201cGetTech\u201d process.\n\n-  Faculty considering the use of genai themselves, or possible use by students in\ntheir classes, should refer to the Center for Teaching Excellence\u2019s page,\n\n\nAppropriate Use of genai 1\n\n-  **Cite your source(s).\n\n** genai, as of this writing, is somewhat notorious at not\nproviding proper citations as to where it borrows information from in constructing\nanswers to questions.\n\nIf you use genai, you should cite either the original sources,\nif possible, or simply that you used a given genai engine on a given date.\n\nSimilarly, if you use genai to generate images, you should cite this in the image label.\n\nThis\nis a traditional practice in academia and should be neither a surprise nor an\ninconvenience, and it is also ethically appropriate not to claim credit for others\u2019 work, aka\nplagiarism.\n\n-  **Inspiration and summarization** .\n\nUsing genai to draft a document, or to shorten\na document from say 3 pages to 1 page, can save significant time.\n\nGiven that the\ntechnology is currently prone to errors and biases, you should carefully review any such\nmaterial generated by genai \u201cDangers\u2026\u201d (see below) and consider citing your use of the\ntechnology if it contributes substantially to the final product.\n\n-  **Research** .\n\nExperimenting with this technology as an analytical or research tool, while\nmindful of the \u201cDangers\u2026\u201d (see below), is immensely important to the University and to\nsociety as a whole as we grapple with a very different technology than what most of us\nare used to.\n\nPlease share what you learn, even if informal, with the rest of the community.\n\n1\nMaterial in this section is reworded for academia from \n\n\n-----\n\nDangers of genai 2\n\n-  **Privacy** : Whenever using or interacting with an genai system, such as when chatting online\nwith ChatGPT, or asking an genai system to analyze or summarize data for you, be aware\nthat any information you enter into the system can not only be processed but also retained\nand used by the genai to give answers to others.\n\nThis means if you enter any personal\ninformation about yourself or any confidential Boston College information, that\ninformation will be stored and potentially shared with or sold to others.\n\nDo not share or\nenter any information that you consider sensitive, personal, or is confidential Boston\nCollege data or research data.\n\n-  **Algorithmic Bias:** UNESCO has warned that \u201cgenai is not neutral: genai-based decisions are\nsusceptible to inaccuracies, discriminatory outcomes, embedded or inserted bias.\u201d Users\nof genai must be cognizant of this.\n\n-  **Recreating Voice/Video** : genai solutions can take a recording of a person\u2019s voice \u2013 your\nvoice for example \u2013 and then use it to create real-time audio that sounds just like you.\n\nSo,\na cyber attacker could create a message that sounds like you, potentially tricking your\ncoworkers into thinking you called and asked them to take an action.\n\ngenai can also do this\nwith pictures or video.\n\nSometimes called Deep Fakes, an genai solution can take an existing\npicture or video of you and use it to recreate entirely new pictures or videos (including\nyour voice) appearing to show you doing things that you never did.\n\nBecause of this, you\nshould be wary of posting extensive voice or video of yourself on the Internet, and also\nbe skeptical of recorded messages of colleagues.\n\nFinally, do not mis-use the technology\nto engage in this type of re-creation yourself.\n\n-  **Wrong Answers** : Regarding the data or answers genai provides, the solutions can be wrong.\n\ngenai often uses public information from the Internet, and its answers may be influenced by\nthe biases of its developers or the data it was \u201ctrained\u201d on.\n\nWhile typical search engines\nare designed to provide you the \u201cbest\u201d or most correct answer to your queries, solutions\nlike genai may be designed to give you the most human-like answer.\n\nWhich\napproach is better depends on what you are attempting to accomplish.\n\nPeople also give\nwrong answers, of course.", "Which\napproach is better depends on what you are attempting to accomplish.\n\nPeople also give\nwrong answers, of course.\n\nBut we already know this and know to check peoples\u2019 answers\n\u2013 genai answers should also be checked as

the Great City Schools (CGCS) and CoSN (Consortium for School Networking) worked in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop a K-12 genai (genai) Readiness Checklist Questionnaire .\n\nThis questionnaire is designed to guide K-12 school districts in understanding key factors to consider before implementing genai technologies.\n\nWhile not an exhaustive readiness assessment, the checklist serves as a preliminary tool for district leaders\u2014including superintendents, district leaders and technology experts\u2014to evaluate the safety, privacy, security, and ethical implications of using genai.\n\nThe goal is to help districts prepare adequately, ensuring data privacy and security, and avoiding bias or algorithmic discrimination, while gaining a foundational understanding of the related tactical considerations.\n\nThe K-12 genai Readiness Checklist Questionnaire is the first tool that CGCS, CoSN, and AWS are planning to introduce to school districts to help them prepare their organizations for adoption of this transformative technology.\n\nOur next phase will build upon the foundational considerations outlined in this checklist.\n\nWe plan to introduce a more comprehensive tool that will allow districts to self-evaluate their readiness for implementing genai technologies.\n\nThis rubric will help districts identify their maturity level in terms of genai readiness and pinpoint specific areas that require further attention to ensure safe and secure adoption of this transformative technology.\n\nWe hope that school districts will find the K-12 genai (genai) Readiness Checklist Questionnaire both useful and informative.\n\nThis tool is intended to serve as a starting point for intelligently and thoughtfully implementing genai technologies that align with instructional and operational objectives.\n\nWe encourage district leaders to adapt this resource to their unique needs.\n\nOnce the Creative Commons License is finalized,

Staff Use of genai for K-12 School Districts:\n\nIntroduction:\ngenai (genai) language models can assist with various tasks from teaching and\nlearning, to writing support, to data analysis.\n\nDistrict staff who have access to genai tools should\nunderstand underlying behaviors and the potential benefits and limitations associated with use.\n\nThis\ninterim guidance outlines recommendations regarding the types of data that may and may not be entered\ninto consumer or commercial genai products, with specific considerations for the safety and\nproductivity of K-12 schools.\n\nIt also offers an overview of limitations to be aware of when using generative\ngenai and offers some current best practices for working with these tools.\n\nThe creation of future genai usage\npolicies will be handled at the local board level in collaboration with administrators and community\nstakeholders.\n\n_This sample guidance document is to support school districts and should be modified and_\n_reviewed with independent legal counsel as needed prior to implementation._\n\nRecommended Practices:\n\nFor district users using genai tools that are not governed by a formal agreement with the district,\nwe recommend the following practices.\n\n-  **Consider Impact:** Assess the potential consequences of using genai, especially in terms of data\nprivacy and integrity.\n\n-  **Critical Evaluation:** Encourage cross-referencing genai information with reliable sources and consult\nwith educational technology experts.\n\n-  **Stay Informed:** Regularly update knowledge on genai advancements and adapt district guidelines\naccordingly.\n\n-  **Alignment to Goals:** Where applicable, align genai integration to how it supports existing school\nimprovement goals.\n\nRisks and Limitations:\nUsers of genai should be aware of other risks and limitations related to the output generated by\nthese products.\n\n-  **Misinformation and Inaccuracies:** Actively verify the accuracy of genai-generated content and\ntimeliness, especially for subjects prone to rapid changes.\n\n-  **Bias:** Regularly evaluate genai outputs to identify and mitigate biases, ensuring fairness in\ninformation dissemination.\n\n-  **Inappropriate Content:** Monitor genai tools for potential generation of or response to offensive or\nunsuitable content.\n\nDisclosures:\nIt is important for educators to set exemplary standards in the use of genai technology.\n\nStaff who use genai are\nexpected to:\n\n-  **Clearly Disclose genai Involvement:** Whenever genai tools contribute to the development of higher\nprofile educational materials, research, or work-related artifacts, or are being used to\n\n\n-----\n\nrecord/summarize

**Educate Through Example:** In demonstrating the use of genai, staff aim to educate.\n\nDescriptions of\nhow genai was used should be informative, helping the audience understand genai\u2019s role and\ncapabilities.\n\n-  **Continuously Update Citation Practices:** With the lack of identified current best practices, there is\nno formal language for citations.\n\nThe district is committed to staying informed about widely\naccepted genai citation practices and updating guidelines accordingly.\n\nWith or without genai, citation of\nprimary sources for information is always a best practice.\n\nData Stewardship:\nAll data use must comply with all state and federal laws and organizational regulations and requirements,\nincluding the district's acceptable use and data policies.\n\nEthical considerations in alignment with the\ndistrict's mission, vision, and values must also be considered.\n\nAlthough genai products may claim\nto have some privacy safeguards in place, users should assume that all consumer genai products\nmake data publicly available unless otherwise indicated per explicit official agreement with the school\ndistrict.\n\nIn addition to the expectations above, specific types of data should be handled in different ways when\nusing a genai product:\n\n-  **Compliance:** Ensure all genai interactions comply with state and federal laws, especially regarding\nstudent data under FERPA , IDEA , CIPA , and COPPA .\n\n-  **Ethical Use:** Align genai tool usage with the district's mission, ensuring it supports strategic and\neducational objectives.\n\nStudent and staff Acceptable Use Policies should be reviewed and\nupdated regularly.\n\nData Types:\n\n-  **Public Data:** Use genai for general information and academic topics within the bounds of district\npolicies.\n\n-  **Confidential/Private Data:** Strictly prohibit entering sensitive student data, personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), or any information protected by privacy laws.\n\n-  **Research Data:** Prioritize anonymization and legal compliance when using genai for research\npurposes in education.", "-  **Research Data:** Prioritize anonymization and legal compliance when using genai for research\npurposes in education.\n\n-  **Intellectual Property:** Be cautious with proprietary or confidential information that is otherwise\nprotected under contractual agreements.\n\nBy adhering to these disclosure principles, as educators, we not only enhance the credibility of our work\nbut also position ourselves as responsible leaders in the educational application of genai technology.\n\nFurther guidance regarding more specific needs like handling genai in teaching and learning\nactivities, selecting and adopting genai tools, creating sample syllabus language, and more should follow as\nthe district continues to explore how to effectively leverage these new tools in a way that meets\nstakeholder needs while keeping data and users

can produce impressive outputs,\nwhether well-structured and fluently\nwritten reports, images and graphics,\ncomputer code, or mathematical\nsolutions.\n\nThey have a huge potential\nrange of applications.\n\n2) This technology is becoming ubiquitous,\nembedded within major software\nsuites (such as Microsoft Office, Google\nWorkspace, etc) and browsers, and has\nspurred the development of a large\nnumber of new apps and tools proffered\nby a myriad of start-ups and project\nteams.\n\n3) It is crucially important for everyone to\nbe aware that these tools generally are\nbased on mimicry and reproduction of\ncontent, style, and genre and are not\nalways optimised to provide factually\ncorrect answers.\n\nNor should their speed,\nconversational interface, and apparent\nquality of their output be taken as\nevidence of any \u2018intelligence\u2019 or subject\nexpertise.\n\n4) There are concerns about how the tools\nare developed and trained (around\ncopyright, intellectual property, wellbeing\nof those hired to screen and label content,\nenergy usage, etc) as well as how they may\nbe misused or misapplied.\n\n5) It is important that everyone is familiar\nwith their current institutional policy on\nthe use of GenAI, bearing that it is likely to\nbe updated on a regular basis.", "###### What lecturers and other educators need to know and do\n\n1) Be familiar with these tools and\ntheir availability, and recognise their\nlimitations and affordances.\n\n2) As soon as you can, review all your\nassessments, replacing or modifying any\nwhich may be completed satisfactorily by\nsomeone using genai without an appropriate\nlevel of understanding of the subject,\nor which are vulnerable to breaches of\nintegrity or security.\n\nIf you identify a\nparticular appropriate role for GenAI in\nyour courses, then ensure that students\nare aware of what constitutes authorised\nand unauthorised use.\n\n3) Work with colleagues, and within\ndisciplinary communities, to design\nassessments which have strong validity\n(i.e., clearly aligned with the learning\noutcomes and the skills which they are\nmeant to demonstrate) and in which\nthere is an appropriate balance of credit\nbetween the process of preparing for and\nundertaking the assessment and the\nfinal product, helping students develop\nself-efficacy, critical thinking, and a\nprofessional disposition.\n\n4) Take the opportunity, at programme\nlevel, to review overall assessment\nvolume, range of assessment types, and\nalignment with intended programme\noutcomes across the complete\nprogramme and year cohorts, identifying\nany vulnerabilities, over-assessment, and\nopportunities for enhancement.\n\n5) Be consistent in your approaches to\nstudent training, assessment practice,\n\n\n-----\n\nand in the implementation of institutional\nacademic integrity policies, data\nprotection, and assessment regulations.\n\nThere must be clear information for\nstudents that unauthorised submission\nof the output of GenAI as their own work\nconstitutes academic misconduct and\nwill be treated accordingly.\n\n6) In your partnership with students,\nemphasise values such as integrity, trust,\nand truthfulness as being at the heart\nof learning, knowledge discovery and\ncreativity.", "###### What programme managers and institutional leaders need to do\n\n1) Ensure that there is up-to-date and regular\ntraining for all staff and students on\nacademic integrity, genai, and assessment,\nand that appropriate resources are\nallocated to this area to ensure that all\navail of it.\n\n2) Programme leaders should work with\ncolleagues to plan and undertake a\ncomprehensive review of assessment,\nfocusing on validity, range of types, and\nvolume, with a view to enhancing both\nthe programme design and the student\nlearning experience.\n\n3) Update, and regularly refresh, policies on\nacademic integrity, including the use of\nGenAI, and assessment to more effectively\nreflect and respond to these issues\nand take the opportunity to reiterate\nthe valuable educational purposes of\nassessment.\n\n4) Develop an institutional ethos and culture\nwhich emphasises integrity, honesty,\ntrust, and respect, rather than let the\nconversations be dominated by suspicion,\nsurveillance, and distrust.\n\nWorkshops and\ntraining events which promote dialogue\nand engagement can be valuable in this\nregard.", "###### What students need to know and do\n\n1) genai tools are appearing everywhere these\ndays: embedded within packages that are\nused to write text, produce slide-decks;\nor in new apps and services that get\npromoted on social media.\n\nThey can be\nuseful for many types of tasks, but they\nalso have serious limitations and can\ngive unreliable answers whilst appearing\nconfident and convincing.\n\n2) It is crucial to be aware of what these tools\ncan and cannot do, as well as recognise\nthe ethical concerns associated with their\ndevelopment and use.\n\n3) Assessment is meant to provide\nthe student with an opportunity to\ndemonstrate achievement of the intended\nlearning outcomes of the module or\nprogramme, to the standard required.\n\nLecturers often use assessment tasks as\na means of helping students focus on the\nkey knowledge and skills that they need to\ndevelop and encourage them to practice\nand build their confidence.\n\nIt is important\nthat students submit work that they have\nproduced and acknowledge the sources\nused, as well as paying close attention to\n\n\n-----\n\nthe requirements of the task and policies\non academic integrity.\n\n4) In reality, assessment can be stressful,\nbut to maintain integrity (both personal\nintegrity and that of the qualifications),\nstudents should resist any attempts to\ntake \u2018shortcuts\u2019 or engage in any form\nof misconduct (copying, plagiarism,\nsubmitting materials produced largely\nby GenAI, etc).\n\nIf a student feels unable to\ncomplete the assessment for whatever\nreason, they should discuss this with\ntheir lecturer, counsellor, SU Officer\nor appropriate person and see what\nalternative arrangements can be made.\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----", "###### What everyone needs to know\n\n(1) genai is becoming ubiquitous and embedded\nwithin more of the tools and software\nwe use in everyday life and in research,\nlearning, and teaching.\n\nThe pace of change\nis rapid and it makes sense to anticipate\nfurther significant advances over the next\nfew years.\n\nBrowsers, word-processing\npackages, spreadsheets, presentation\nsoftware, audio, imaging, graphics, and\nvideo tools are all increasingly making\nuse of such technologies, including core\nproduct suites from Microsoft and Google.\n\nBy default, users of these tools will be\npresented with \u2018suggestions\u2019 on anything\nwhich they write or design.\n\n(2) GenAI tools such as the \u2018Large Language\nModels\u2019 on which ChatGPT, Bard, and\nothers are based, are designed to write\nwell in terms of language, style, and\nsyntax, rather than in terms of whether\nwhat they write is factually correct or\naccurate.\n\nIt is crucially important to\nunderstand how such technologies work\nand be aware of their limitations as well\nas their apparent strengths.\n\nThey are\nnot \u2018intelligent\u2019 in any real sense, nor are\nthey experts on topics, but rather largely\nrely on statistical predictions of word\ncombinations or image features.\n\n(3) There are also concerns about ethical\n(and environmental/energy use) aspects\nin how such tools are developed, trained,\nand deployed and it is important to be\naware of these, particularly with regard the\nlack of transparency on the information\nthat has been used to \u2018train\u2019 the systems\nand whether copyrighted materials have\nbeen used and sources which are heavily\nbiased Some moves are being made\n\n\nRecent releases of tools built on \u2018Generative\ngenai\u2019 have made headlines across the world.\n\nAt first glance, their capabilities seem\nimpressive: writing fluent text on any subject,\neloquently expressed with excellent structure\nand grammar; producing visually arresting\nimages in any specified genre; constructing\n(and explaining) computer code for simple\nor complex tasks; suggesting statistical\ntests for data sets and producing a range of\nanalyses; solving mathematical and other\nsymbolic manipulation challenges.\n\nTheir speed\nof response, their conversation-like ability to\nbuild on previous prompts and answers, and\ntheir (superficially, at least) plausible output,\nhowever, runs the risk of anthropomorphism\nand the presumption that behind the scenes\nthere is a nascent, if not fully enacted,\n\u2018intelligence\u2019.\n\nThe implications of these tools for assessment\nare very significant as they run the risk of\nincreasing intentional and unintentional\nmisconduct.\n\nIn addition, beyond assessment,\nin the wider world, they may well contribute\nto the dissemination of misinformation,\nfalse accusations, libel, breach of copyright,\ninsertion of erroneous computer code into\nsystems, and other legal and ethical issues.\n\nUsed well, they could offer benefits for learners,\ndocument preparation, media production, and\neven lead to newer forms of creativity.\n\nClearly,\na critical digital literacy which addresses the\ndevelopment and deployment of genai is essential\nfor all of us.\n\nIn these guidelines, however, we will focus on\nassessment and have grouped together key\ninformation and suggested courses of action\nfor staff, students, and higher education\ninstitutions in the short-term.\n\n-----\n\ninternationally to consider potential forms\nof regulation, although quite what shape\nthese will take is very uncertain.\n\n(4) As technologies develop, appropriate roles\nin education may be found, but if they\nare used to bypass rather than support\nthinking, or used to acquire academic\ncredit which has not been earned via real,\nintellectual engagement with the subject\nof study, then they can undermine the\neducational enterprise.\n\nPart of the current\nchallenge for educators, learners, and\ninstitutions is to determine the range of\nbeneficial applications which might be\nafforded by such tools.", "###### What lecturers and other educators need to know and can do\n\n(1) Ensure that you are aware of recent and\nnew genai tools, including those\nassociated with supporting writing, and\nothers which might be relevant to your\nparticular discipline, such as those which\nassist the development of computer code,\nsolve mathematical problems, generate\ngraphics, video, and audio content,\netc.\n\nTry to understand what these tools\ncan and can\u2019t do (including by trying\nthem out on your own assignments or\nsubject content), and, in particular, avoid\nmistakenly attributing subject expertise,\nintelligence, or capacity for reflection to\nsuch software.\n\nIt is useful also to be aware\nof ethical and legal concerns over how\nsuch tools are developed and used, as well\nas the potential inequality of differential\naccess (e.g., on the basis of cost).\n\n(2) Increasingly, educators are sharing use\ncases of where genai tools might be useful\nin designing courses, lesson planning,\nassessment design, student feedback, etc.\n\nWhilst as the technology improves, there\nis no doubt that GenAI will be more useful\nin many professions and contexts, we still\nurge caution, particularly in terms of the\naccuracy of its outputs and the fact that\nit is largely based on statistical models\nand hence reproduces or mimics rather\nthan being capable of generating original\ncontent.\n\nThere are many cases where a\ntraditional search strategy (using a search\nengine or library tools) is much more\neffective and has the added benefit of\nidentifying original sources and allowing\nyou to make judgements about accuracy\nand quality as well as to provide due\ncredit to the original authors.\n\nThis is a key\npoint that should also be included in any\ntraining of students about information\ngathering and research.\n\n(3) If you are using GenAI tools in your own\nacademic practice, then you should\nmodel appropriate use with your students,\nacknowledge where GenAI has assisted in\nyour work, etc.\n\nIt is important not to input\npersonal, private, sensitive, or copyrighted\nmaterials (including student work) into\nsuch tools unless you have appropriate\nlevels of legal guarantees.\n\nMany of the\nfreely available tools at the moment do\nnot have such protections in place.\n\n-----\n\n(4) In designing assessment, it is important\nto ensure validity, i.e., that assessment\nshould be a means whereby each student\ndemonstrates that they have attained\nthe intended learning outcomes to an\nappropriate standard and that this should\nbe the basis on which academic credit is\nawarded.\n\n-  It is important to clarify and reiterate\nthis point with students and to\ndemonstrate how the assessment fits\nthis intention.\n\n-  It may be appropriate to revisit your\noriginal learning outcomes to ensure\nthat they are aligned with how you\nteach, the tasks you set students, and\nthe chosen forms of assessment.\n\n(5) If you intend for students to use GenAI or\ngenai-supported tools in any assignment,\nmake this clear.\n\nIt may not be possible\nto simply state \u2018do not use genai for this\nassignment\u2019 given the technology\u2019s\nubiquity, so the emphasis should be\non what the student actually does to\ndemonstrate their attainment of the\nintended learning outcome with which\nthe assignment is aligned.\n\nIf the student\nconstructs a report or essay through\nclever \u2018prompt engineering\u2019 which could\nhave been done by anyone not taking\nthis module, then this does not provide\nthe basis for an award of marks or\ncredit.\n\nWhere students are expected to\nuse genai tools, ensure there is clarity on\nhow and why they used such, with an\nappropriate declaration on any submitted\nassignments.\n\n(6) There will be cases where it is clearly\ninappropriate to use GenAI and, in those\ncases, state this clearly in the instructions\nprovided to students and ensure that\nyou are able to make the format of the\nassessment sufficiently secure and\nrobust.\n\n(7) Academic Integrity is breached if students\nsubmit the products of GenAI as their\nown work without acknowledgement\nor without authorisation to use GenAI\nin fulfilling the task.\n\nIt is important to\nensure that students are informed that\nthis constitutes academic misconduct\nand that they should only be seeking\ncredit for work which they have\nproduced themselves, and that they are\nresponsible for correctly referencing and\nacknowledging sources and resources\nused in their work.\n\n(8) Review all assessments and assignments\nin terms of whether or not they are\nsusceptible to being completed\nsuccessfully by an genai tool without the\nstudent having to engage intellectually,\nor personally, with the subject.\n\nSome\ncommon types of assessment should be\nno longer considered to be sufficiently\nrobust to award scores which count\ntowards official grades.\n\nThese may still be\nperfectly valuable for self-assessment and\nformative practice.", "These may still be\nperfectly valuable for self-assessment and\nformative practice.\n\nThese include:\n\n-  Take-home essays, reports, or similar\ndocuments focused largely on subject\nknowledge content and with an \u2018all\nor nothing\u2019 submission by a single\ndeadline and where marks

rely on GenAI \u2018detection systems\u2019.\n\nNone of the tools which are currently\navailable are fully capable of detecting the\nuse of GenAI (except in the most obvious\ncases which may also have been identified\nby expert reading and scrutiny) and may\nalso lead to \u2018false positives\u2019 (incorrectly\nconcluding that human-written text was\ngenai-generated) and difficult-to-interpret\nscoring.\n\nDetection systems cannot\nbe relied upon to detect use of GenAI\naccurately or consistently.\n\n-  In addition, there may be serious data\nprotection, privacy, and intellectual\nproperty concerns in the use of any\nsuch tool, particularly if it has not\nundergone appropriate approval by\ninstitutions.\n\n-  Turnitin\u2019s detection tool is available\nin some institutions, but users\nshould be aware of concerns about its\ncapabilities in terms of more recent\nversions of GenAI, a reported high\nrate of \u2018false positives,\u2019 and some\nambiguity on how to interpret its\nresults.\n\nIt may be that you feel that a\nshift towards more weighting\nfor assessments undertaken in\n\n\n-----\n\n(12) Consider what scope there is for\nassessments which:\n\n-  Focus on \u2018process rather than product\u2019.\n\nIn other words, where credit is\nassociated with the various tasks or\nstages that the student goes through\nin order to lead to the final product.\n\nThis can be done by breaking down\nassignments into key stages and\nincorporating student reflection/\nreporting on how they found their\nsources, what aspects they explored,\nwhat challenges they overcame, etc\n(or whatever is appropriate to the\nparticular assignment) so that there is\na developmental journey.\n\n-  Are clear in terms of whether the\nemphasis is on the development of\nwriting skills (something the genai tools\ncan do very well) or on understanding\nof the specific topic and assess each\nof these with appropriate methods and\nrubrics.\n\n-  Are reflective and based on personal/\nprofessional experiences and which\nare authentic to the discipline or\nprofession.\n\nNote that many of the genai\ntools will readily invent \u2018reflective\u2019\ncontent if so asked, so try to ensure\nthat the task is genuinely connected\nto the student, or the specifics of\nparticular aspects discussed in class.\n\n-  Are in different or multiple formats,\nsuch as video or audio content, a\nmix of presentation (with questions\nand answers) and ancillary materials\n(e.g., reference list, handouts), etc.\n\ngenai tools can produce slide decks\nand write scripts for video/audio\n\n\ncontent, so, again, be careful about the\nrequirements.\n\n-  Are based on whether the learning\noutcomes have been achieved by the\nstudent, rather than leading to a grade.\n\n-  Use in-class writing assignments or\nproblem-solving tasks.\n\n-  Are based on, or partially include, an\noral component in which the students\nare asked to answer questions around\nthe topic and how they approached the\ntask.", "-  Are based on, or partially include, an\noral component in which the students\nare asked to answer questions around\nthe topic and

authentic\nassessment) which align with the\ndiscipline or profession.\n\nWhere it isn\u2019t\npracticable for a very large cohort, at\nleast consider undertaking a number\nof orals either on the basis of random\nselection or to clarify any concerns\nin a particular submission (i.e., this\nis where the main assignment is an\nessay, report, video, etc, and the oral is\nto check on integrity and/or on student\nunderstanding).\n\n(13) Work with colleagues to develop an\neffective strategy for assessment which\nideally would address issues of student\n(and staff) workload, the scheduling of\ndeadlines/due dates, and ensuring that\nprogramme level outcomes are being met.\n\n-  We know that academic misconduct\ncan arise when people inappropriately\nreact to:\n\n**\u25e6** **\u0007**

of consequence for\nsuch behaviour.\n\n(14) Always comply with and follow your\ninstitution\u2019s academic integrity policy\nand report any suspected cases.\n\nBeing\nconsistent in policy implementation is\nsomething which will shape students\u2019\nperceptions about the seriousness of\nthe issue and that the policy is one\nwhich focuses on education and the\ndevelopment of professional values,\nreducing the potential for repeated\nmisconduct and protecting the reputation\nof qualifications.", "###### What programme managers and institutional leaders need to do\n\n(1) Ensure that all staff are informed and\nkept up to date and provide training\nopportunities for all staff and students on\nthese issues and technologies.\n\n(2) Review approaches to assessment

way to ensure the integrity of\nassessment this can run counter to the\nstrength of more authentic assessment\nwhich aims to develop skills, knowledge\nin context, and other professional and\ngraduate attributes.\n\nA short-term reweighting of assessments may be\nnecessary to respond quickly to these\nnew challenges, but the longer-term goal\nshould be to take a more holistic approach\nto assessment as/for/of learning.\n\n(4) Review policies on academic integrity and\nassessment to more effectively reflect\nand respond to these issues and take\nthe opportunity to reiterate the

considering the\nimpact on instructional practices and student learning experiences and outcomes.\n\ngenai are just the newest\nexamples of these emerging technologies, with previous generations experiencing advances in technology such as the\ninternet, graphing calculators, smart phones, etc.\n\nWhile genai has the potential to support access to learning\nin classrooms for all students, these technologies can exacerbate inequities for students from marginalized student\ngroups in the absence of thoughtful policy, practice, and educator support and training.\n\nGiven the influx of genai in education, several organizations have come together to provide guidance on the use of genai in\neducation in addition to resources for teaching about genai.\n\nExamples include:\n\u25aa The CRAFT (Classroom-Ready Resources About genai For Teaching Project ), developed by Stanford University\u2019s\nGraduate School of Education has resources to support high school teachers in supporting students\u2019 genai literacy.\n\n\u25aa Teach genai , a partnership between major education organizations, including Code.Org, ISTE, the World Economic\nForum, National Association of State Boards of Education, National School Boards Association, Educational\nTesting Service, Khan Academy, and ISTE was developed in an effort to to provide guidance to policy-makers and\neducational leaders around genai in education.\n\n\u25aa The Hands-On genai Projects for the Classroom from ISTE and GM has developed guides for elementary and\nsecondary teachers to support student-driven learning related to genai and its impacts on society.\n\n-----", "## What are the Equity Implications of genai in K-12 Classrooms?\n\nWhen developing policy around the use of genai in K-12 classrooms, it is important to take into consideration\nthe fact that genai is a component of a larger digital learning ecosystem.\n\nWhile digital learning and education\ntechnology has the potential to address inequities when implemented with an equity focus and mindset, in the\nabsence of this intention, digital learning and education technology can also exacerbate existing inequities and make\nschooling more difficult for those who are already marginalized within the system.\n\nEquity implications to keep front and center when designing policy specific to genai in K-12 classrooms\nincludes bias, innaccuracy, plagiarism, copyright/licensing unknowns, and equity of access.\n\nTable 1 provides examples\nof strategies to address these equity implications.\n\n\u25aa **Bias:** As genai uses algorithms created by human designers, there is a strong potential for the introduction\nof bias into the system.\n\nSome examples include privileging certain language variations, showing racial and gender\nbiases, having a United States-centric lens, and providing only a limited perspective.\n\nAs genai uses large\ndata sets, historical and systemic biases are introduced into the system.\n\nFurther, as genai lacks cultural\nknowledge and experience, this can lead to misinterpretations of prompts given and answers that privilege a\ncertain cultural perspective.\n\n\u25aa **Inaccuracy:** As genai draws from large data sets, it is not guaranteed to be accurate as not all information\non the internet is accurate.\n\ngenai is only as good as the data that is fed into the machine learning algorithms.\n\nAdditionally, genai is not necessarily coded to provide accurate information, rather it simply predicts the\ntype of information needed to best fit a given Prompt.\n\nFor example, when asking ChatGPT for sources to support\ninformation provided, there are times in which the sources are fabricated.\n\nThis is known as \u201cgenai hallucinations.\u201d 4\n\n\u25aa **Plagiarism:** A common concern from educators is that genai and other genai technologies will be used by\nstudents to write essays and complete assignments.\n\nAs genai does provide written responses to prompts,\nthis concern has led a number of districts across the nation toward banning the platform due to a concern for\ncheating and plagiarism.\n\n\u25aa **Copyright/ Licensing Unknowns:** Understanding copyright laws is an important element of using generative\ngenai and other genai technology in the classroom, in that as this is new technology, there are not clear boundaries\nregarding who owns the content generated by genai.\n\nAs companies continue to develop licenses on their products, it\nis important for educators to reflect on the implications of copyright/licensing unknowns.\n\n\u25aa **Equity of Access:** Access to genai and lack thereof can have broad and deep equity impacts on students \u2013\nboth while in K-12 education and for college and career readiness.\n\nGiven the inherent equity impacts of introducing genai into the digital learning ecosystem, educating students,\nfamilies, and educators (including paraeducators, secretaries, support staff, etc.)\n\non these equity implications\ncan help to move toward using genai in ways that are culturally responsive and sustaining for students,\nfamilies, and communities.\n\nAdditionally, when developing policy, it is important that creating and cultivating a digital\nlearning ecosystem wherein equity is at the heart of the decision making process is key to ensuring that the learning\nexperiences that students engage in honor their sociocultural identity and lived experience.\n\n4 Shripad Shenwai, D.

ChatGPT and copy and paste the response as your answer.\n\n2.\n\nThe use of genai must be open and documented.\n\nThe use of any genai in the creation of your work must\nbe declared in your submission and explained.\n\nYour faculty can provide guidance as to the format\nand contents of the disclosure.\n\nThe undeclared use of any genai (including text, images, program code,\nmusical notation, etc) in any work may be considered as plagiarism.\n\n3.\n\nEngage with genai Responsibly and Ethically.\n\nEngage with genai technologies responsibly, critically\nevaluating genai-generated outputs and considering potential biases, limitations, and ethical\nimplications in your analysis and discussions.\n\nEnsure that the data used for genai applications are\nobtained and shared responsibly.\n\nNever pass off as your own work generated by genai.\n\n4.\n\nYou are 100% responsible for your final product.\n\nYou are the user; if the genai tool makes a mistake,\nand you use it, then it\u2019s your mistake.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know whether a statement about any item in the\noutput is true, then it is your responsibility to research it.\n\nIf you cannot verify it as factual, you should\ndelete it.\n\nYou hold full responsibility for genai-generated content.\n\nIdeas must be attributed, and sources\nmust be verified.\n\n5.\n\nThese principles are in effect unless the instructor gives you specific guidelines for an assignment\nor exam.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure you are following the correct guidelines.\n\nNot following\nthem will result in a breach of

discussions.\n\nThere is no shortage of public analysis regarding the ways in which the use of genai (genai) tools (such as\n\nChatGPT) \u2013 which are open-access tools that can generate realistic text, computer code, and other content in response to prompts\n\nfrom the user \u2013 provides both challenges and opportunities in higher education.\n\nAccordingly, exploring the use of genai in ways that\n\nalign with Brown\u2019s values has been a topic of discussion among our senior academic leaders for several months.\n\nAs we identify the\n\nways in which genai can enhance academic activities for faculty and student success and administrative activities for staff, we must\n\nalso ensure these tools are understood and used appropriately and ethically.\n\nBelow is a list of resources where you can find guidance on the following:\n\ngenai Usage Guidance\n\nThere is a diversity of practice among faculty regarding genai, and instructors may choose whether or not to allow the use of genai tools\n\nand to what extent.\n\nWhile the University is not prescribing specific genai policies, faculty should offer clear, unambiguous information\n\nabout what is, and is not, allowed in their courses.\n\nThe Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning at Brown provides sample\n\nsyllabus language as well as other tips for classroom integration.\n\nAgain, links to these and other resources in this message are\n\nprovided at the bottom of this email.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nOne of the most common concerns about genai is the potential for plagiarism, or students using the system to do work that they then\n\npresent as something they created without genai assistance.\n\nAny unapproved use of genai to complete assignments would be covered by\n\nBrown\u2019s Academic Code and Academic Code, Graduate Student Edition .\n\nCitation and Attribution\n\nIf you choose to use genai tools for course assignments, academic work, or other forms of published writing, you should\n\ngive special attention to how you acknowledge and cite the output of those tools in your work.\n\nThe Library has compiled general\n\nguidelines for citing genai-generated content, as well as more specific guidance from the three major style guides.\n\nProtecting Information\n\n\n-----\n\nInformation Technology (OIT) provides guidance on how to make sure you are not exposing important or sensitive data to these\n\nservices.\n\ngenai as a Research Tool\n\nThe rapid emergence of genai technology offers great potential for researchers as they design, conduct, support, and present their\n\nresearch.\n\nHowever, there are also a number of challenges and risks to understand when using these tools in the research domain.\n\nOIT's Center for Computation and Visualization has published a reference guide to understanding and using genai as a\n\nresearch tool.\n\nThe guide also includes a helpful glossary of genai terms.\n\nProtecting Intellectual Property\n\nWhile genai has great potential for university research, Brown investigators contemplating using genai tools in their own\n\nresearch should be cognizant of the various intellectual property issues related to its use.\n\nThe Office of the Vice President for\n\nResearch (OVPR) has published Initial Guidance for Researchers , which offers important information for researchers about the\n\nintersection of genai and intellectual property, as well as considerations around public disclosure and patentability.\n\nNext Steps\n\ngenai tools will rapidly evolve in the coming months and years, and Brown is well positioned to innovate in this space.\n\nExperts from\n\nacross our campus \u2013 from engineering, public health, medicine, the social sciences, the humanities, policy leaders and\n\ntechnologists \u2013 have already been incorporating genai into their work.\n\nI encourage all of you to experiment with genai to find ways it\n\ncould be helpful to your academic experience.\n\nBeginning in the fall, the Data Science Institute will partner with the Office of the Provost for \u201cConversations on genai and our data-\n\ndriven society,\u201d a series of monthly campus-wide discussions about the impact of genai on how we live, work, and educate the next\n\ngeneration The Library has also planned weekly discussions and working groups to address various issues surrounding genai from\n\ndifferent perspectives.\n\nI look forward to continued discussions with academic leadership as we monitor the evolution of these tools and discover\n\ninnovative applications to improve

Fast, K.\nLinder Bey, Veronica Machado, Erica Maddox, Suleima, Lora Roy) in Spring 2023 with the\nsupport of Lance Eaton, Director of Faculty Development & Innovation.\n\nFor more\ninformation about this project, these guidelines, etc, please contact Lance Eaton at\n .", "## Definition\n\n**genai Generative Tools** : We define \u201cgenai generative tools\u201d as including (but not necessarily\nlimited to): the use of technologies that rely on machine learning, large language models\n(LLMs) and other advanced data-manipulation tools to produce distinct answers or\noutputs based upon prompts by the user.\n\n**Usage** : Usage of genai generative tools includes engaging with such tools to generate\nspecific content that contributes to the submission of any activity or assignment or\nwork to be evaluated in a course or requisite for graduation (e.g.\n\nBig 10, LIPS), including\nbut not limited to papers, presentations, discussion posts, etc, by students or by faculty,\nincluding but not limited to learning content, presentations, assessments, feedback, etc.", "### Student Guidelines\n\n1.\n\nEach instructor at College Unbound may have student usage policies that are\n\ndifferent in terms of expectation and approach to using genai generative tools.\n\nAn\ninstructor\u2019s syllabus policy supersedes these guidelines in terms of appropriate\nusage, however an instructor cannot require students to create accounts with\nunaffiliated organizations for the purposes of any assignment.\n\nIn the absence of\na specific course policy, these guidelines stand as the default expectation.\n\n2.\n\nIf students choose to use these tools in some capacity that results in content\n\nfrom the genai tool making it into submitted student work, they must\nmake clear and evident what portion of the work is generated by the genai tool and\nwhich genai tool they used.\n\na.\n\nWhen available, use the appropriate citation format (e.g.\n\nMLA or APA) as\n\nindicated by the instructor or syllabus.\n\nb.\n\nIn absence of a particular citation format, students should use quotation\n\nmarks around the genai generated-text and include a Works Cited that\nincludes both the tool that was used (e.g.\n\nBard, ChatGPT) and the prompts\nused.\n\nc. For visual materials or audio materials, consult your instructor on how\n\nthey would want them particularly documented.\n\n-----\n\nd. In situations where students use genai as part of the\n\nbrainstorming or organizing process, they are not obligated to cite or\nreference.\n\n3.\n\nStudents are discouraged from copying entirely the content directly from an\n\ngenai-generative text tool into their course work.\n\nStudents should edit and revise the\ngenai-generative tool\u2019s output, unless there are significant reasons not to (e.g.\n\nthe\ninstructor\u2019s guidelines say otherwise).\n\na.\n\nUse genai tools as a supplement to your learning, not as a replacement for\n\ntraditional learning methods.\n\nWhenever possible, make sure the genai tool is\naccurately guiding your learning.\n\nb.\n\nWith regard to LIPS, Big 10s, and other reflective practices, students may\n\nuse such tools as a resource for insight and further understanding, but\ntheir reflective submissions should be still created by the student entirely.\n\n4.\n\nStudents who do not adhere to these guidelines (or ones specified within a given\n\ncourse syllabus), will be subject to the process highlighted in the Student\nHandbook\u2019s policy (Academic Honesty item #6 on pg 107) .\n\n5.\n\nStudents must get documented permission by faculty before putting original\n\nfaculty content into any genai-generative tool.\n\nThis might include communications,\nfeedback, learning content, and the like.\n\n6.\n\nIf students choose to use these tools in some capacity related to their work, the\n\nsubmitted work should be less than 50% generated by the genai tool unless\notherwise stipulated by the instructor or assignment guideline.\n\n7.\n\nStudents are responsible for the possible negative outcomes of using\n\ngenai-generative tools in the submission of their work as they relate to College\nUnbound and its community.\n\nThese negative outcomes include but may not be\nlimited to:\n\na.\n\nThe accuracy of the content of an genai-generative tool.\n\ni.\n\nFor example, ChatGPT has been known to provide sources that do\nnot exist or links that do not work.\n\nIntegrating these into one\u2019s work\nfails to meet the standards of appropriately identifying one\u2019s\nsources of influence in a given work.\n\nb. Usage that results in inappropriate harm to the wellbeing of\n\nothers\u2013individually or collectively.\n\ni.\n\nFor example, using material generated by genai that results\nin reinforcing stereotypes (in written, oral, and visual mediums) for\nassignments or materials related to one\u2019s work at CU.\n\nc. Usage that violates the privacy or security of other individuals.\n\ni.\n\nFor example, students should not enter names and personal\ninformation or writing of other people (students, faculty, staff, etc)\n\n\n-----\n\nto produce an output for any work or activity related to their role at\nCU.\n\nd. Usage that undermines the academic integrity of assessments, exams, or\n\nothers evaluations at College Unbound.\n\ni.\n\nFor example, putting students\u2019 work into a genai tool for the\npurposes of checking for plagiarism or generating feedback\n(without students\u2019 permission).\n\ne. Any other usage that violates CU\u2019s policies.\n\nf.

Usage that results in inappropriate harm to the wellbeing of\n\nothers\u2013individually or collectively.\n\ni.\n\nFor example, using material generated by genai that results\nin reinforcing stereotypes (in written, oral, and visual mediums) for\nthe purposes of teaching and learning.\n\nc. Usage that violates the privacy or security of other individuals.\n\ni.\n\nFor example, faculty should not create a chat thread on ChatGPT\nfor each student, where they update ChatGPT about how the\nstudent is doing and requests feedback/strategies about that\nstudent\n\n\n-----\n\nd. Usage that undermines the academic integrity of assessments, exams, or\n\nothers evaluations at College Unbound.\n\ni.\n\nFor example, putting students\u2019 work into a genai tool for the\npurposes of checking for plagiarism or generating feedback\n(without students\u2019 permission).\n\ne. Any other usage that violates CU\u2019s policies.\n\nf. If you are looking to use genai in connection with your course, it is\nrecommended to reach out and talk with the Director of Digital Pedagogy\nto double check different assumptions about usage.\n\nA final note about these policies: Because this technology is both new and continuing\nto change, we recognize that these policies cannot and will not cover every situation.\n\nShould issues and edge cases arise which fit outside these guidelines, CU\nrepresentatives will operate from a position of good faith in trying to address each case,\nwhich will also be used to help us refine these policies.\n\n-----", "## Education systems continue to face challenges in access, equity and quality\n\nAccess to education remains a significant challenge, particularly in low-income countries and\nmarginalised communities.\n\nMillions of children are unable to attend school or access education\ndue to a lack of infrastructure, financial barriers, cultural norms and other factors.\n\nA UNESCO\nreport estimates that 224 million children and youth are out of school globally, with low-income\ncountries hardest hit.\n\nIt is further estimated that children from the poorest 20% of families are\neight times more likely to be out of school as children from the richest 20% in\nlower-middle-income countries.\n\nWhile the global out-of-school rate is gradually decreasing, this\nshift is too slow and large gaps still exist between different regions.\n\nEquity in education is a different pressing concern, arising when disadvantaged students face\nsignificant barriers to educational success.\n\nThese barriers include disadvantages based on\nsocio-economic background, gender, ethnicity, and disability, as well as unequal access to\nresources such as well-trained teachers, textbooks, and technology.\n\nDisadvantaged students\nare more likely to attend poorly-performing schools, with fewer resources and less experienced\nteachers, while girls are twice as likely to be out of school than boys.\n\nWithin this context of\ninequity, some educators, researchers and students have access to cutting-edge digital tools,\ncapable and experienced experts and innovative pedagogical methodologies, while others make\ndo with limited access to even the most basic educational tools, resources and educational\ndelivery techniques.\n\nAs a result, disadvantaged communities often have lower levels of\neducational attainment and fewer opportunities for future success.\n\nThe last focus of concern for this paper is around the provision of high-quality learning\nexperiences that meet the needs of all students.\n\nOutdated curricula, inadequate teacher training\nand limited resources can all contribute to low-quality education outcomes.\n\nThere is often a\nmismatch between the skills that students learn in school and the skills that are in demand in\nthe labour market, leading to high levels of youth unemployment and underemployment.\n\nIn\nclassrooms teachers use a mix of digital and non-digital tools for their delivery, with their focus\nand time split between developing teaching plans and resources, delivering content, creating\nand grading assessments and coursework, in addition to other administrative tasks.\n\nA study\nconducted by EdWeek Research Centre shows that teachers work 54 hour weeks, with only half\nthat time spent in student engagement like instruction, skill development and coaching.\n\nThis\nleaves little room for thinking about enhancing and furthering the curriculum, student experience\nor providing specialised, tailored learning.\n\nThe quality and appeal of teaching is variable depending on the capabilities of the professionals and the training and resources available to\nthem.\n\nFurther consideration needs to be given to what students are being taught and assessed\non, and how much of it relies on memorization of facts versus application of skills, thought\nprocesses and capabilities that can be extrapolated to a variety of situations and contexts.\n\n-----", "## The transformative power of genai can help resolve some of these challenges\n\ngenai technologies can help dramatically shift the landscape to address the gaps\noutlined above.\n\nThe capability to ingest, interrogate and build connections within vast amounts\nof data allows genai to produce content such as text, images and sounds presents new\nopportunities and applications for educators, researchers, students and parents that can\nenhance their experiences.\n\ngenai can improve the quality of course materials and\npersonalise them based on students' learning styles and specific needs, such as learning\nchallenges and preferences.\n\nIt can create simulations and virtual environments, resulting in\nmore engaging courses.\n\nAdditionally, genai can assist in creating new teaching materials and\nresearch content and produce images with specific modifications that respond to particular\nacademic needs.\n\nThe use of genai tools for such tasks frees up time for work that can potentially\nhave more impact on the learning experience.\n\nGiven the ongoing speed of technology and societal change, content needs to be continuously\nrefreshed, to remain relevant; genai can enhance the quality of outdated or low-quality\nmaterials leading to deeper understanding of the content and better outcomes for educators,\nstudents and researchers.\n\nIt can be used to generate personalised learning materials and\nassessments for students, and it can create personalised assessments for students to test their\nknowledge and gauge their understanding of a topic.\n\ngenai can offer virtual tutoring environments\nthrough chat bots and tutoring genai platforms, supporting students with real-time feedback and\nsupport outside of the classroom.\n\nThis is especially useful for those who lack access to\nin-person tutoring or learning resources.", "## The use of genai brings concerns with it\n\nDespite many powerful applications, and the need to reimagine our education systems in the\nlight of new disruptions, genai technologies do come with their own set of unique\nconcerns and challenges.\n\nHere we outline some of the key issues before offering a perspective\non policy changes to address them.", "### 1.\n\nAcademic Integrity, Ethics and Code of Conduct\n\nStudents and researchers creating content using genai tools and calling it their own work is\nchallenging academic integrity, ethics and code of conduct.\n\nEducational and research\ninstitutions around the world have employed various measures to address these issues,\nincluding requiring students and researchers to disclose their use of genai tools such as\nChatGPT.\n\nHowever, this does not provide a clear solution as the outputs generated by genai tools\nare a combination of the system-generated content, developer inputs, and user edits.\n\nThis\ncreates a grey area in identifying and defining plagiarism and outlining sensible guidelines on genai\nuse.\n\nWhile tools to detect whether content is created by genai are being developed and deployed,\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir effectiveness varies and the sophistication of means and mechanisms to get around them\nwill continue to evolve in parallel.", "### 2.\n\nKnowledge Retention & Skill Development (Learning & Assessment)\n\nWhen skills development focuses on tool usage to access knowledge at the expense of\nexpertise, a student\u2019s ability to think critically and build deep knowledge is impacted.\n\nStudents\nare not able to assimilate knowledge without spending time with it, applying problem-solving and\ncritical thinking techniques to dissect and analyse it.\n\nResearch on the psychology of learning\nindicates that this is critical for students to absorb the content and develop crucial thinking\nstrategies.\n\nHowever, the use of genai tools can sideline this type of learning, leaving\nstudents vulnerable to shallow thinking and lacking in fundamental understanding.\n\nIt is important\nfor students to predict, explain, and hypothesise to learn, rather than relying on ready-made\nanswers that may only provide basic knowledge but fall short of critical, creative, and innovative\nthought.\n\nWhile the use of genai technologies will become a skill on its own, understanding how to\nbuild appropriate supporting knowledge and skillsets is important.", "### 3.\n\nBias, inaccuracy and privacy\n\nThe content produced by genai tools is based on the data that was used to train it,\nwhich is raising concerns about potential bias, misinformation, lack of global understanding and\noverestimation of genai capabilities resulting in incorrect output.\n\nOpenAI, for example, has currently\nnot disclosed details about the training methods and materials used for ChatGPT, making it a\nblack box.\n\nAlthough large amounts of data may be used for training, it is essential to question\nthe nature and origin of that data which is reflective of the types of biases and misinformation\nthat could inflict harm.\n\nIf the training material focuses heavily on certain geographical regions or\nparticular views, this limits the likelihood of reliable, global and inclusive output required to cater\nto users, especially students in their formative years and researchers publishing their findings,\nacross the globe.\n\nRecently the risk of genai systems being \u2018poisoned\u2019 by actors deliberately feeding\nthem misinformation maliciously has been noted, leading to increased concerns about the\naccuracy and bias of genai outputs.\n\nPrivacy and transparency concerns have been top of the agenda in recent years, as members\nof society at all levels increasingly use technologies for day-to-day tasks, and sharing their data.\n\nThere is not yet a clear view on how genai data is stored and handled, and for what\npurposes.\n\nThe use of genai needs to be navigated cautiously given the potential involvement of\nminors and the disclosure of confidential information.", "### 4.\n\nFurther Risks to Access and Equity\n\ngenai technology has the potential to increase socio-economic divides due to\naccessibility and equity factors, which may disadvantage marginalised communities and limit\ntheir access to equitable opportunities.\n\nCommunities that struggle with access to digital tools\n\n\n-----\n\nand internet connectivity do not have the same level of access to technologies as better\nsupplied communities.\n\nIn addition, the data that is used to train the technology may not be\nrepresentative or inclusive with respect to ethnicity, gender, or disability, making its use\ndetrimental.\n\nIt is important to recognise these issues and find ways to minimise any potentially\nnegative impact of genai on education and society.", "### 5.\n\nTraining and Development\n\nIn light of the challenges and concerns surrounding genai in education, its integration\ncurrently poses a significant challenge for educators, researchers, and institutions.\n\nThe lack of\neducation, training and guidance available for the responsible and ethical use of these tools, as\nwell as limited understanding of their full capabilities and implications, contribute to this\napprehension.\n\ngenai technologies are innovative and disruptive, but it is important to\nremember that they are not a replacement for the human mind.\n\nPeople working with them need\nto develop the right capabilities to make best use of them as tools to be used alongside human\ncreativity and critical thinking, while being aware of their risks and acting accordingly.", "## Recommendations to the G20 and Policy makers\n\nAs of now, there is no single comprehensive policy or regulatory framework in place that\nspecifically addresses the use of genai in education.\n\nHowever, some existing regulations and\npolicies that touch upon it, albeit indirectly, for instance, in the US, the Family Educational Rights\nand Privacy Act (FERPA) and Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) mandate that\nstudent data collected by technology providers should be kept private and secure.\n\nLikewise, in\nthe European Union, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a legal framework\nfor the protection of personal data.\n\nThese regulations also apply to the use of genai in education, as\nthey regulate the collection, use, and storage of personal data in any context.\n\nMoreover, there\nare some emerging frameworks that aim to guide the ethical use of genai in education; for example,\nthe OECD Principles on genai, the UNESCO Recommendation on genai and Education, and the\nAI4ALL program of the National Science Foundation, USA.\n\nHowever, these frameworks are still\nin their nascent stage, and their effectiveness in regulating genai use in education remains to be\nseen.\n\nGovernments worldwide can use these as a starting point but need to develop robust and\ncomprehensive regulations and policies tailored to the ethical use of genai in education to ensure\nthat student data privacy and overall well-being are adequately protected.\n\nThey have a\nresponsibility to promote the development and adoption of genai while also addressing\nthe concerns articulated above.\n\nAs the capabilities of genai (and other emerging\ntechnologies) continue to expand, policymakers need to develop a nuanced understanding of its\nbenefits and risks, and enact policies that can effectively manage its impact on education\nsystems and society at large.\n\n-----", "### Policy Consideration 1: Access and use in the teaching learning process\n\nInstead of an outright ban (like in the case of Italy - subsequently reversed - or Saudi Arabia) or\nallowing unrestricted use of genai in the classroom, policy makers (and institutions) will\nneed to consider various scenarios in which use of genai will benefit students across\ndifferent age groups and segments (K-12 vs Higher Education) and provide for inclusion of the\ntechnology in the teaching and learning process.\n\nSome well researched use cases can help\nprovide teachers and students with guidance on how best to implement specific types of tools.\n\nThis should be supported through the promotion of genai literacy among students and educators,\nincorporating genai-related topics such as machine learning, natural language processing, and\nneural networks into existing curricula.\n\nPolicy makers need to ensure that genai led education tools\nare accessible to students of all backgrounds, emphasising diversity and inclusion in both the\nstudy and application of genai.\n\nA starting point here might be to shift emphasis from\nstudent/teacher content creation towards the evaluation of content to boost and develop critical\nthinking, for example, teaching students and teachers the importance of effective prompting.", "### Policy Consideration 2: Redrafting learning outcomes\n\nThe use of genai in the day-to-day teaching and learning process could hinder the\ndevelopment of key skills like critical thinking and the ability to assimilate and analyse\nknowledge.\n\nStudents need guidance on how to leverage technologies while retaining\nfundamental learning and development.\n\nThe integration of genai tools creates an opportunity for\neducators and researchers to develop innovative approaches to teaching, assessment, and\ncontent development, thus enhancing the state of academia, for example genai can help\nto define tasks to ensure personalized learning for students.\n\nIt will encourage a move away from\nless effective or more time-consuming tasks, such as memorization or reviewing large bodies of\nliterature, to a model that promotes higher-order skills for educators, students, and researchers.\n\nThis can be achieved, for example, by focusing on reflection on or discussion of created content\nrather than focusing on the creation of content itself.", "### Policy Consideration 3: Ethical framework for genai\n\nThe development of an ethical framework for genai encourages its safe and responsible use, which\ncan be provided through guidelines and standards that govern the design, development and\ndeployment of genai technologies in education systems across schools and universities.\n\nThe\nframework should cover aspects such as privacy, transparency, accountability, and fairness.\n\nIt\nshould support the declaration by genai systems of their design process so that the right systems\ncan be identified which protect the privacy and personal information of students, teachers, and\nother stakeholders.\n\nWhile it is the responsibility of developers to carry out rigorous testing and\nvalidation of genai algorithms and ensure that they adhere to ethical and legal standards, educators\nalso need to be adequately trained and equipped to handle the technologies and ensure that\nstudents' welfare is prioritised.\n\nAny framework should promote transparency and logic, ensuring\n\n\n-----\n\nthat genai models and algorithms are easy to understand and interpret, and outline use cases to be\nsupported.\n\nIt should be highlighted that frameworks for genai \u2013 like former ones for internet usage\nfor example \u2013 cannot be fully enforced, but the objective here is to make students, parents and\nteachers aware of the guidelines and the implications of not adhering to them.", "### Policy Consideration 4: Data Privacy and Security\n\nThe sensitive nature of personal information that is shared between students, teachers, and\nadministrators during the learning process makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks and privacy\nbreaches.\n\nSchools, universities and educational systems must take a proactive approach to\naddress these concerns by instituting robust data privacy and security policies that protect the\npersonal information of students, teachers, and staff.\n\nAnother critical area of concern is data governance.\n\nSchools and universities need to establish\nguidelines and protocols for the collection, storage, and sharing of data in ways that align with\nethical and legal standards.\n\nThey must ensure that they comply with applicable regulations such\nas GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy\nActs) and others as they evolve to cope with genai.\n\nA starting point may be to create\ndefault privacy and security processes with options for individuals to modify according to his or\nher preferences.\n\nDepending on culture as well as national and organizational priorities, there\nare opt-out and opt-in approaches that can be implemented.", "### Policy Consideration 5: Incorporating genai training for Educators and Students\n\nTo fully leverage genai potential, educators need to be trained on how to integrate the technology\ninto their teaching effectively.\n\ngenai training should be included in teacher preparation programs\nand continued professional development.\n\nTeachers need to know how to identify appropriate genai\ntools, how to use them effectively, mitigate risk, and how to evaluate genai-generated content.\n\nStudents should be taught basic genai concepts to be able to participate in the development of genai\nsolutions in the future.\n\nEducators can incorporate genai training into the curriculum by developing\ncourses and workshops to ensure students have practical experience using genai tools.\n\nAs genai\nbecomes more integrated into the educational system, it is important to prepare students for the\njobs of the future.\n\nGovernments can enable partnerships that provide industry-relevant training\nprograms and provide financial incentives for schools that make genai and other emerging\ntechnologies available to underserved communities.", "### Policy Consideration 6: Promote transparency and accountability\n\nOne of the most significant concerns related to the use of genai in education systems is\nthe potential for bias and discrimination.\n\nTo promote transparency, institutions need to be open\nabout their use of genai systems, including the algorithms used and the processes\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowed.\n\nInstitutions should also provide explanations of how the technology works and how\ndecisions are made based on the data collected.\n\nThis transparency can help build trust between\ninstitutions, educators, parents, and students, and will help to ensure that the use of generative\ngenai in education is ethical and unbiased.\n\nA mechanism is required to ensure that institutions and\neducators are responsible for the decisions made by the systems they use.\n\nFor instance, if a\nstudent is penalised for a mistake made by a genai system encouraged by the school,\nthat institution must be accountable for the error.\n\nEducational institutions need to establish clear\nguidelines, policies, and procedures for the use of these systems, including how they collect and\nanalyse data, identify potential biases and ensure impartial decision making.\n\nIn addition,\ninstitutions should routinely monitor and audit the genai system's performance to identify\nany errors or biases, and take appropriate measures to correct them.\n\nAn important part of this is\nidentifying the appropriate supervisory body or bodies to be involved, taking into account\nnational and international approaches and guidelines.", "### Policy Consideration 7: Public engagement\n\nThe use of genai in education raises ethical concerns such as privacy, data security, and fairness in\ndecision-making.\n\nPublic engagement, including with industry, allows for and encourages open\ndiscussion about these issues and provides an opportunity to address misconceptions and fears\nsurrounding genai in education as well as building awareness which protects against manipulation.\n\nPublic input and feedback can also inform the development of effective policies and guidelines\nthat govern the use of genai in education.\n\nThis helps to create a transparent and\naccountable framework for the deployment of the technology.\n\nEngaging the public in the\ndecision-making process helps to build trust between the community and the institutions\nworking with genai.\n\nThis trust and inclusive attitude are important for the successful adoption and\nacceptance of genai in education.", "### Policy Consideration 8: Education led genai\n\nThe education sector itself needs to be a leader in the development of its own genai based tools\nthat build on this new technology and open the opportunities it offers to learners at all levels.\n\nIn\nthis way the sector can gain better control of contractual terms and technical and organisational\nmeasures in the application of genai.\n\nIn addition, it will create a safer space for students to train in\nand make the institution both safer and more competitive.\n\nThis does not mean that government\nor institutions need to become genai developers, but partnerships with ed tech and companies are\na good starting point to develop bespoke tools, work through the ethical, behavioural and other\nchallenges that are being raised, which will allow the sector to lead in this field rather than be\nreactive to what is to come.\n\n-----", "## G20\u2019s Role: Call to action for governments to take proactive and responsible steps to shape genai use in education\n\ngenai is here to stay and grow exponentially.\n\nAccording to a Forbes article published in\nMarch 2023, generative-relevant use cases already present a significant enterprise opportunity,\nwith an estimated market of $2.6 billion in 2023 which is expected to grow at a rate of 32% until\n2026.\n\nAs with previous disruptive technologies, such as calculators, computers and the internet,\ngenai technologies will become another tool in the education ecosystem.\n\nWe need to\nrethink how to learn, grow and develop in a world where genai is commonplace, be\nprepared for further transformations and we must do so while being aware of its uses and\ndeficiencies, its strengths and limitations.\n\nThis ongoing disruption demands proper guardrails in\nthe form of forward-looking policy.\n\nThe G20 recognizes the importance of digital technology and its potential to enhance social\ndevelopment and economic growth.\n\nThe G20 Digital Economy Ministerial Declaration\nacknowledged the need for policies that support the development and use of genai technologies\nwhile also addressing ethical and social considerations.\n\nThe time is now to act on policy\ndevelopment, especially in education.\n\ngenai has the

generate\nresponses but they have significant limitations.\n\nIt is important that all students and staff\nunderstand the opportunities, limitations and ethical issues associated with the use of these\ntools and can apply what they have learned as the capabilities of genai develop.\n\nThese include:\n\n\n(a) Privacy and data considerations: whether a genai tool is designed to learn directly\nfrom its users\u2019 inputs or not, there are risks to privacy and intellectual property associated\nwith the information that students and staff may enter.\n\n(b) Potential for bias: genai tools produce answers based on information generated by\nhumans which may contain societal biases and stereotypes which, in-turn, may be\nreplicated in the genai tool\u2019s response.\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n\n\n-----\n\n(c) Inaccuracy and misinterpretation of information: data and information contained within\ngenai tools is garnered from a wide range of sources, including those that are\npoorly referenced or incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, unclear commands or information may be\nmisinterpreted by genai tools and produce incorrect, irrelevant or out-of-date\ninformation.\n\nThis means that accountability for the accuracy of information generated by\nthese tools when transferred to another context lies with the user.\n\n(d) Ethics codes: users of genai tools should be aware that while ethics codes exist,\nthey may not be embedded within all genai tools and that their incorporation, or\notherwise, may not be something that users can easily verify.\n\n(e) Plagiarism: genai tools re-present information developed by others and so there is\nthe risk of plagiarised content and/or copyright infringement being submitted by a user as\ntheir own, and artwork used by image generators may have been included without the\ncreator\u2019s consent or licence.\n\n(f) Exploitation: the process by which genai tools are built can present ethical issues.\n\nFor example, some developers have

education policy**\n\nWith genai tools becoming easily accessible to the public in recent months, they\nare rapidly being integrated into various fields and industries.\n\nThis has created an urgent\nneed for universities to develop an genai education policy that prepares students to work\nwith and understand the principles of this technology.\n\nThere are several rationales supporting this need.\n\nFirstly, genai technology is becoming more prevalent in many sectors of the economy,\nsuch as finance (Bholat & Susskind, 2021 ; Buckley et al., 2021 ), healthcare (Eggmann\net al., 2023 ; Yu et al., 2018 ), and transportation (Abduljabbar et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2022 ).\n\nAs a result, graduates will need to have a strong understanding of genai principles in order\nto succeed in these fields.\n\nAn genai education policy can provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills to work with genai in a professional capacity.\n\nSecondly, genai has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society, including education itself (Adiguzel et al., ).\n\ngenai can be used to enhance student learning by providing personalized, real-time feedback and adapting to individual learning styles (Atlas, 2023\n\n2023 ; Chan & Hu, 2023 ; Luckin, 2017 ).\n\nBy educating students on genai, universities can\nhelp prepare them to be active participants in the development and implementation of\ngenai technology, ensuring that it benefits society as a whole.\n\nThirdly, as the use of genai in education and assessment becomes more prevalent, it is\nessential that students understand the principles behind the technology in order to\nmaintain academic integrity and prevent cheating as mentioned previously (Chan,\n2023 ; Cotton et al., 2023 ).\n\nAn genai education policy can teach students about the ethical\nconsiderations surrounding genai, such as bias and fairness, as well as the potential consequences of using genai in academic contexts.\n\nFourthly, developing an genai education for university is important to prepare students\nfor the future (Aoun, 2017 ).\n\ngenai technology is rapidly advancing, and it is likely to play\nan increasingly important role in society in the coming years.\n\nBy providing students and\nteachers with training in genai, universities can help ensure that graduates are equipped to\ncontribute to the development of genai and to navigate the ethical, social, and economic\nissues that are likely to arise as genai becomes more widespread.\n\nSuch training should also\nhelp students become competent and responsible users of genai in their daily lives.\n\nFinally, it is also worth mentioning that previous genai policies in education did not anticipate the level of advancements that text-based GPT 3.5 and 4 can now achieved.\n\nGiven\nthe potential benefits and risks associated with the use of genai in education, it\nis important to develop a proper genai education policy that addresses these concerns and\nprovides guidance on the responsible use of genai.\n\nConducting research in genai policy in education within Hong Kong is specifically justified due to the city\u2019s unique position as a global hub of technology, commerce, and\neducation, coupled with its evolving education landscape.\n\nAs a dynamic metropolis\nwith a strong commitment to technological innovation and a richly diverse education\nsystem, Hong Kong presents a compelling case study for the exploration of genai policies\n\n\n-----\n\nin education.\n\nIts blend of Eastern and Western educational philosophies and practices\noffers a fertile ground for examining the impacts and opportunities of genai integration in\nvaried educational contexts.\n\nFurthermore, as Hong Kong is actively striving to enhance\nits digital learning capabilities and infrastructure, studying genai policy could provide valuable insights into the challenges and best practices of implementing genai in education,\nthereby potentially informing genai education strategies not only in Hong Kong but also in\nother global contexts.\n\nThe study employed a comprehensive approach to data collection, gathering rich\nquantitative and open-ended survey data from a diverse range of stakeholders in the\neducation community to ensure that it reflects the needs and values of all those involved.\n\nThe combination of these data sources allowed for a holistic understanding of the topic\nunder investigation, providing a nuanced and multifaceted view of the issues at hand.\n\nBy\ndoing so, we can help to ensure that the use of genai in education is both beneficial and ethical.", "**Existing policy on genai**\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the education policy related to genai, however, it is\nessential to also scrutinize the existing policies governing genai as a whole.\n\nAs genai expands\nits sphere of influence to various sectors in our society, there are increasing concerns\nover the risks of its usage and how it might impact human activities (genai regulation,\n2023 ; World Economic Forum [WEF], 2023 ).\n\nSome of the major issues of concern that\nhave drawn the attention of governments around the world include discrimination and\nbias of genai, loss of privacy, violation of human rights, and malicious use of genai (Greiman,\n2021 ) caution that misuse of genai could encourage manipulation of people, create social division, and exacerbate inequalities, posing ; Hogenhout, 2021 ).\n\nFederspiel et al.\n\n( 2023\nexistential threats to the human race.\n\nIn view of this, countries have been working on\nnational policies and strategies to provide clearer guidance on genai usage in order to maximize its benefits while mitigating the threats brought by it.\n\nTo advocate the responsible and proper management of genai technologies, the centre\nof focus for most national policies on genai have fallen on the discussion of ethics, which\ndeals with \u201cthe standards of right and wrong, acceptable and not acceptable\u201d (Hogenhout, 2021 , p. 11).\n\nFloridi ( 2021 )\u2019s framework for the ethical use of genai, which proposed\nthe 5 core principles of \u201cbeneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability\u201d , is referred to by most national policies on genai as a foundation to further develop\non.\n\nIn addition, Dexe and Franke ( 2020 ) summarized the genai strategy documents from\nthe Nordic countries and identified various ethical principles as the implicit foundation\nfor further developing policies.\n\nThe official genai governance framework from Singapore\nalso recognized the \u201cexplainable, transparent and fair usage of genai in decision-making\nprocess\u201d and \u201chuman-centric genai solutions\u201d as the guiding principles of ethical use of genai\n(IMDA & PDPC, ).\n\nApart from individual countries, ethics has been the emphasis of the genai policies published by regional and international bodies.\n\nUNESCO developed its guidelines on the ethical use of genai technologies by emphasizing the key idea 2020\nof human-centeredness and hence, human rights and values laid out in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR) are advised to be adopted as the necessary foundation to further promote beneficial and appropriate use of genai technologies (UNESCO,\n\n\n-----\n\n2021b , 2023 ).\n\ngenai strategy in the European Union, as Renda\u2019s ( 2020 ) analysis pointed out,\nalso focused on ethics and highlighted a human-centric approach to genai.\n\nIn order to protect EU citizens from the danger of abusive use of advanced technologies, EU proposed\nits own pillars (legal compliance, ethical alignment and sociotechnical robustness) to\nensure the trustworthiness of genai and established a specific genai expert group to work on\nspecific policy recommendations and guidelines.\n\nThe heavy focus that these national and regional policies has placed on ethics demonstrates how limited they can do for the implementation of genai technologies.\n\nOn the\none hand, difficulty to lay down a universal definition on ethical principles becomes a\nhinderance for certain countries in formulating policies on the use of genai (Dexe & Franke,\n2020 ).\n\nOn the other hand, as genai can weave into the fabrics of everyday human activities, the resulting wide coverage of policy areas ranging from governance to education\nand even to environment makes it a challenging task for government to establish specific\npolicies on genai usage (UNESCO, ).\n\nThus, as the Singaporean genai governance framework highlighted, model framework or ethical guidelines were in themselves directional 2021b\nand for reference only, and genai practitioners need to consider them with flexibility and\naccording to the relevance of particular situations (IMDA & PDPC, 2020 ).\n\nMoving forward, the ongoing efforts of national and international organizations to\nensure the positive implementation of genai technologies will continue to prioritize discussions and the formulation of legal and ethical principles (genai regulation, 2023 ; UNESCO,\n2023 ).\n\nHowever, until these principles are validated by real-time implementation of genai\ntechnologies, they will remain primarily predictive and prescriptive in nature (Chatterjee, 2020 ).\n\nOver time, it may become necessary for countries to establish institutional\nsupport systems to effectively manage genai practices in accordance with validated legal\nand ethical guidelines (Renda, 2020 ).\n\n**Table 1** Compilation of fundamental ethical principles (IMDA &PDPC, 2020 )", "**Fundamental ethical principles for genai**\n\n1.\n\nAccountability: Ensure

of a compilation of fundamental ethical principles for genai that have been\nextracted from multiple policies (IMDA & PDPC, 2020 ) (Table 1 ).", "**Existing policy on genai in education**\n\nThe integration of genai technologies into teaching and learning has begun as early as\nthe 1970s and nowadays, different forms of these technologies are used in various\neducational contexts, such as the use of personalized applications for learning and\nassessment and information systems that help handle administrative and management tasks in schools (Al Braiki et al., 2020 ; Schiff, 2022 ; UNESCO, 2021a ).\n\nAs mentioned above, the use of genai technologies has raised different issues of concern (Chan & Tsi, 2023 ; Chan & Zhou, 2023 ).\n\nIn the educational contexts, other\nthan the general risks brought by the use of genai, concerns are primarily centred on\nissues such as what changes can genai bring to the design of assessment and curriculum,\nequalities and universality in accessing these technologies, redefinition of teachers\u2019\nrole, and the lack of technological infrastructure for emerging economies (Pelletier\net al., 2022 ; Popenici & Kerr, 2017 ; Swiecki et al., 2022 ; TEQSA, 2023 ; UNESCO,\n2021a ).\n\nBased on these concerns, genai policies in education fix their eyes on addressing a number of issues: literacy education to prevent inequalities in the use of digital technologies (Southgate, 2020 ; UNESCO, 2021b ); essential values of traditional\nforms of teaching and learning such as teacher-student and student\u2013student relationships (Luan et al., 2020 ; UNESCO, 2021b ); inclusiveness and equity in the use of genai\ntechnologies (Tanveer et al., 2020 ; UNESCO, 2021a ); professional development of\nteachers to enhance teachers\u2019 competence and assist them to transform their roles\n(Oca\u00f1a-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2021 ); and training and enhancement of\nskills or \u201cmicro-credentials\u201d for students that are important and necessary for harnessing technologies (Pelletier et al., 2022 ; UNESCO, 2021a ).\n\nThe roles of literacy\neducation and skills training are having particular implications for the wider society\nas the population in general also needs to be prepared for the implementation of genai\ntechnologies in different sectors.\n\nDespite identifying multiple issues of concern in the educational contexts, policies\non genai in education are mostly generic and implicit because of the lack of concrete evidence of implementing genai technologies (UNESCO, 2021a ).\n\nIn Schiff ( 2022 )\u2019s review on\n24 genai policy strategies focusing on the role of education in global genai policy discourse, it\nwas found that policymakers view education largely as an instrumental tool to support\nworkforce development and training of genai experts.\n\nThe article finds that the use of genai\nin education is largely absent from policy conversations, while the instrumental value\nof education in supporting an genai-ready workforce and training more genai experts is overwhelmingly prioritized.\n\nThe article suggests that if such a trend continues, policymakers\nmay fail to realize genai in education\u2019s transformative potential and may fail to sufficiently\nfund, regulate, and consider genai in education\u2019s ethical implications.\n\ngenai scholarship and\neducation governance do not receive adequate attention in the current literature (Gellai,\n2022 ), and public understanding of the policy implications of genai is limited (Feldstein,\n2019 ).\n\nWhile more work is still to be done in order to formulate more comprehensive\nand focused policy documents on genai in education, ethics was reiterated again as a strategically plausible starting point for further discourse and researchers were especially\n\n\n-----\n\nencouraged to engage further with policymakers through their work on ethics in the use\nof genai in education (Sam & Olbrich, 2023 ; Schiff, 2022 ).\n\nIn view of this gap, this research\nintends to propose a policy framework for integrating genai in higher education, taking into\nconsideration aspects of teaching and learning as well as ethical and practical concerns.\n\nIn this research, we will employ the guidelines put forth by UNESCO ( 2021a ) as\nthe starting point for crafting a more accurate genai policy for university teaching and\nlearning.\n\nThe rationale for employing UNESCO recommendations as the basis is multifaceted.\n\nFirst, UNESCO is an esteemed international organisation with significant\nexpertise in education, their recommendations are supported by thorough research\nand knowledge from experts worldwide.\n\nThese recommendations are designed to be\nrelevant and flexible for a variety of educational systems and cultural settings, making\nthem suitable for diverse institutions.\n\nUNESCO\u2019s guidelines also take a comprehensive approach to incorporating genai in education, addressing important ethical, social,\neconomic, and technological aspects essential for creating effective policies.\n\nUsing an\nexisting framework like UNESCO\u2019s recommendations saves time and resources and\nprovides a well-organized starting point for examining specific genai policy issues in\nuniversity teaching and learning.", "Finally, anchoring the study in UNESCO\u2019s recommendations enhances the credibility of the research.\n\nThe UNESCO framework for genai in education is centred around a humanistic\napproach, which aims to safeguard human rights and provide individuals with the\nnecessary skills and values for sustainable development, as well as effective human\u2013\nmachine collaboration in life, learning, and work.\n\nThe framework prioritizes human\ncontrol over genai and ensures that it is utilized to improve the capabilities of both\nteachers and students.\n\nMoreover, the framework calls for ethical, transparent, nondiscriminatory, and auditable design of genai applications.\n\nFrom the UNESCO\u2019s genai and\nEducation: Guidance for Policy-Makers document, the following recommendations\nare provided:\n\n1.\n\nInterdisciplinary planning and inter-sectoral governance: This recommendation\nsuggests that genai and education policies should be developed through collaboration\nbetween different sectors and disciplines to ensure a comprehensive approach.\n\nFor\nexample, policymakers could work with experts in education, technology, ethics, and\nother relevant fields to develop policies that take into account all aspects of genai in\neducation.\n\n2.\n\nPolicies on equitable, inclusive, and ethical use of genai: This recommendation emphasizes the importance of ensuring that genai is used in an ethical and inclusive manner that benefits all learners.\n\nFor example, policymakers could develop policies that\naddress issues such as bias in genai algorithms or access to genai tools for learners from\ndisadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n3.\n\nDevelop a master plan for using genai for education management, teaching, learning,\nand assessment: This recommendation suggests that policymakers should develop a\ncomprehensive plan for using genai in various aspects of education to ensure its effective implementation.\n\nFor example, a master plan could include specific goals for\nusing genai in areas such as personalized learning or teacher professional development.\n\n-----\n\n4.\n\nPilot testing, monitoring and evaluation, and building an evidence base: This recommendation highlights the importance of testing and evaluating the use of genai in\neducation through pilot projects to build an evidence base for its effectiveness.\n\nFor\nexample, policymakers could fund pilot projects that test the use of genai tools in specific educational contexts or with specific learner populations.\n\n5.\n\nFostering local genai innovations for education: This recommendation suggests that\npolicymakers should encourage the development of local innovations in genai for education to ensure that it meets the specific needs of their communities.\n\nFor example,\npolicymakers could provide funding or support to local startups or research institutions working on developing new genai tools or applications specifically designed for\ntheir region\u2019s educational needs.\n\nUsing UNESCO\u2019s recommendations as a basis, this study aims to examine higher education stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of text genai technology.\n\nBased on their ideas,\nrecommendations, and concerns, an genai education policy framework will be developed\nto promote ethical and effective integration of genai technologies in higher education.", "**Methodology**\n\nIn this study, a survey design was utilized

need to continuously find opportunities for students to develop\nthese skills, preparing them for the genai-driven workplace where they need to be\nadaptable, resilient, and transformational.", "**Triangulating quantitative and qualitative data**\n\nThe quantitative findings support the key areas found in the qualitative data for genai\nintegration in education.\n\nThe quantitative data reveals that both students and teachers share concerns about the potential misuse of genai technologies, such as ChatGPT,\nin assignments (students: mean 3.67, teachers: mean 3.93).\n\nThis emphasizes the need\nfor guidelines and strategies to prevent academic misconduct.\n\nFurthermore, there is\nsignificant agreement among students and teachers on the necessity for higher education institutions to implement a plan for managing the potential risks associated with\nusing genai technologies (students: mean 4.5, teachers: mean 4.54), highlighting the importance of addressing data privacy, transparency, accountability, and security.\n\nThe overall positive perception of genai technologies integration within education\nimplies that proper policies should be in place to ensure responsible genai incorporation\nin higher education.\n\nThe concern that some students might use genai technologies to gain an\nadvantage in their assignments (students: mean 3.67, teachers: mean 3.93) underscores the importance of ensuring equal access to genai technologies for all students.\n\nMoreover, the consensus that students must become proficient in using genai\ntechnologies for their careers (students: mean 4.07, teachers: mean 4.1) highlights the\nneed for genai literacy and training for all stakeholders in the educational process, preparing students for the genai-driven workplace.\n\nInterestingly, teachers and students are unsure if teachers can accurately identify a\nstudent\u2019s use of genai technologies to partially complete an assignment (students: mean 3.02, teachers: mean 2.72), yet they also believe that genai technologies can\nprovide unique insights and perspectives and personalized feedback.\n\nThis suggests\nthat rethinking assessment methods may be necessary.\n\nData indicating that neither students nor teachers believe genai technologies will\nreplace teachers in the future (students: mean 2.14, teachers: mean 2.26) supports the\nneed for a balanced approach to genai adoption, utilizing genai technologies as complementary tools rather than substitutes for traditional teaching methods.\n\nFinally, concerns that genai technologies could hinder students\u2019 development of generic\nor transferable skills, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership (students:\nmean 3.3, teachers: mean 3.74), emphasize the importance of focusing on students\u2019\nholistic competencies and generic skills in preparation for the genai-driven workplace.", "**Key areas versus UNESCO\u2019s recommendations on genai education policy**\n\nThe original plan for the study was to use UNESCO\u2019s recommendations as a basis\nfor developing genai education policy framework for university teaching and learning\nthrough inputs from various stakeholders to identify any gaps in the framework and\n\n\n-----\n\nmodified accordingly.\n\nAlthough the recommendations from UNESCO can provide a\nhigh-level guideline for this study, it was clear that there are several key differences\nbetween UNESCO recommendations and the ten key areas that were identified for\nintegrating genai in university teaching and learning.\n\nAs the UNESCO\u2019s genai and Education: Guidance for Policy-Makers was written\nbefore the availability of GPT 3.5 and 4, the recommendations would not have fully\naddressed the current opportunities and threats of the advances in the GPT technologies for education.\n\nMoreover, the UNESCO recommendations are intended for education in general and\ndo not specifically cater to the needs of university teaching and learning.\n\nThe UNESCO\nrecommendations are high-level and general aimed at helping policy-makers better\nunderstand the possibilities and implications of genai for teaching and learning to help\nachieve Sustainable Development Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all (UNESCO, 2021a ), while the ten\nkey areas are more specific, practical, and tailored to university teaching and learning.\n\nFurthermore, most of the existing genai education policies tend to emphasize the instrumental role of genai for workforce development (Schiff, 2022 ), but the key areas based on\nthe findings of this study also address the transformative potential and ethical considerations relating to genai use in higher education in addition to its instrumental purposes.\n\nThe ten key areas were developed based on direct input from stakeholders who have\nvested interests in university teaching and learning, which makes them more relevant\nand grounded in practice.\n\nFor example, UNESCO\u2019s recommendation to develop a master plan for using genai for education management, teaching, learning, and assessment\nemphasizes the need for a comprehensive and strategic approach to integrating genai in\nvarious aspects of education.\n\nThis includes not only teaching and learning but also the\nbroader aspects of education management, such as administration, resource allocation,\nand policy development.\n\nThe focus here is on creating an overarching framework that\nguides the implementation of genai in education as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, the key\narea derived from the qualitative findings of rethinking assessments and examinations\ndelves deeper into a specific aspect of education: the evaluation of students\u2019 learning.\n\nThis area acknowledges that the integration of genai in education necessitates a\nre-evaluation of traditional assessment methods.\n\nThe focus here is on designing assessments that allow genai technologies to enhance learning outcomes while maintaining\nacademic integrity.\n\nThis involves developing new assessment strategies that focus on students\u2019 understanding, critical thinking, and analysis rather than just their ability to collect information.\n\nIn short, UNESCO\u2019s recommendations highlight the \u201cwhat\u201d , whereas\nthe ten key areas of this study detail the \u201chow\u201d of genai education policy.\n\nIn essence, the difference between these two areas lies in their scope and focus.\n\nUNESCO\u2019s recommendation is broader, encompassing various aspects of education\nand advocating for a comprehensive master plan.\n\nIts primary target is policymakers.\n\nIn\ncontrast, the key area on rethinking assessments and examinations is more specific and\nuser centred, catering for various higher education stakeholders including students and\nteachers as well as addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with genai integration in university teaching and learning.\n\n-----", "## genai Ecological Education Policy Framework\n\na.\n\nUnderstanding, identifying, and\npreventing academic misconduct

for an increasingly genai-driven workplace.\n\nBy focusing on pedagogy, the framework ensures that genai technologies are harnessed to enhance learning outcomes and\ndevelop critical thinking, creativity, and other essential skills, rather than undermining\nacademic integrity.\n\nTeachers are the initiator for the Pedagogical Dimension, as they are\nthe ones who design and implement lesson plans, activities, and assessments that utilize\ngenai technologies.\n\nThey will need to have the expertise to determine how genai can best support and enhance students\u2019 learning experiences.\n\nAt the same time, they must possess\nthe necessary awareness and knowledge to educate students on the potential risks associated with the use of genai in learning, particularly in assessments and assignments, such as plagiarism and contract cheating.\n\nTeachers need to foster ethical use of\ngenai, for example through proper attribution to acknowledge the contributions of genai technologies in student work, and develop assessment tasks that require critical and analytical thinking to avoid genai-assisted plagiarism.\n\nBy assigning teachers the responsibility for\nthis dimension, we ensure that genai tools are used in a way that is pedagogically sound and\nenhances the learning outcomes of students.\n\nThe Governance dimension highlights the importance of addressing issues related to\nacademic misconduct, data privacy, transparency, and accountability.\n\nThe framework\nensures that stakeholders understand and address the ethical challenges associated with\ngenai technologies, fostering responsible use and helping to maintain trust within the university community.\n\nThis focus on governance encourages universities to develop clear\npolicies and guidelines, ensuring that students and staff can navigate the complex ethical\nlandscape surrounding genai.\n\nSenior management will be the initiator for the Governance Dimension of the genai Ecology Framework.\n\nAs they hold decision-making authority, they are tasked with developing and enforcing policies, guidelines, and procedures that address the ethical concerns\n\n\n-----\n\nsurrounding genai use in education.", "These include academic integrity, data privacy, transparency, accountability, and security.\n\nSenior management\u2019s role is to ensure that genai is\nused responsibly and ethically, fostering a learning environment that is fair, equitable,\nand inclusive.\n\nThe Operational dimension of the framework underscores the need for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and support to ensure the effective and equitable implementation of\ngenai technologies.\n\nBy considering operational aspects, the framework encourages universities to provide training, resources, and support to all stakeholders, promoting equal\naccess to genai technologies and fostering an inclusive learning environment.\n\nFurthermore,\nthe operational dimension emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement and\nadaptation, enabling universities to refine their genai integration strategies in response to\nnew insights and changing needs.\n\nTeaching and Learning and IT staff will be tasked to look after the Operational Dimension.\n\nThey play a crucial role in managing and maintaining the genai technologies used in\nthe educational setting.\n\nTheir tasks include providing training and support for both students and staff, ensuring the proper functioning of genai tools, and addressing any technical issues that may arise.\n\nThey can ensure that genai technologies are seamlessly

education policy planning, from which an genai Ecological Education Policy Framework\nis constructed to fulfil the objective of the study.\n\nHowever, this study has some limitations, including a relatively small sample size that may not be representative of all educational institutions.\n\nAdditionally, the research only focused on text-based genai\ntechnology and did not explore other types

USE OF genai IN HIGHER EDUCATION\n\ngenai (genai) is one of the key transformative technologies of the coming\n\ncentury.\n\nIts impact on research institutions and universities is already significant today,\n\nand is likely to continue growing intensively over the coming years.\n\nFor students and scholars, genai can be a powerful tool that enhances their learning\n\nexperience or research endeavors \u2013 but, if used improperly, it can also degrade the\n\nquality of a student\u2019s education and undermine the rigor and impact of scholarly\n\nresearch.\n\nMuch depends on the specific pedagogical or intellectual context within which\n\ngenai tools are being used, and on the ways in which those tools either support or weaken\n\nthe underlying goals of a given academic endeavor.\n\nSince these contexts vary widely, it is\n\nthe policy of Vanderbilt University to leave it up to individual faculty to decide whether\n\nand how genai tools are used in their courses or research work.\n\nBelow we include the most recent Guidance from Faculty Affairs, which stresses the\n\nimportance of each faculty member deciding whether or how to incorporate generative\n\ngenai into course expectations.\n\n-----\n\nexample policies regarding the academic uses of genai as falling along a broad spectrum\n\nthat ranges from permissive to restrictive.\n\nHere we present examples of such policies\n\nthat have been adopted by Vanderbilt faculty hailing from a variety of disciplines.\n\n**We**\n\n**have divided these examples into four basic gradations: permissive;

thinking about the impact of generative artificial\nintelligence (genai) tools on teaching and learning.\n\nSpecifically these guidelines suggest instructors:\n\n-  include a syllabus statement regarding use of genai tools;\n\n-  create transparent and productive learning environments by explicitly discussing appropriate,\ncreative, and/or ethical genai use within a course, discipline, and/or profession; and\n\n-  prevent situations in which a student unintentionally engages in academic dishonesty while\nusing genai tools.\n\nThe University of Arizona Catalog includes a list of required syllabus policies, including The Code of\nAcademic Integrity.\n\nThe phrase \u201cgraded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort\nunless otherwise instructed\u201d can be interpreted differently.\n\nTherefore, instructors should also include a\nstatement specifically addressing course policy on the use of genai and discuss this policy with\nstudents.\n\nIf applicable the syllabus should include information about the use of genai detection\napplications, because these involve sharing student-created work.\n\nExample syllabus statements are\nprovided below.\n\nStudents will potentially face different policies in different courses/assignments in regard to the use of\ngenai.\n\nAlso, there are many different ways students might interact with genai in their\nlearning processes.\n\nClarification about expectations is necessary.\n\nThis is similar to the potentially\ndifferent meanings of the phrase \u201copen book exam.\u201d Does \u201copen book exam\u201d include using the\ntextbook and notes?\n\nRecorded lectures?\n\nThe internet?\n\nTalking with classmates, friends, and family?\n\nIt is\nextremely important to be direct and specific about course policies concerning genai.\n\nStarting with the\nsyllabus, engage with students as partners in\n\n-  learning about types of genai as related to the course, discipline, and profession; and\n\n-  discussing issues of academic integrity", "### II.\n\nThings to Consider About genai, Teaching, and Learning\n\ngenai tools based on large language models (LLMs) simultaneously present exciting\nopportunities and worrisome challenges.\n\nPrior to developing course policies about genai,\nconsider the following issues.\n\n-----\n\n**Learning Goals for Students:** genai tools can augment learning and may be a technology that\nstudents will use in the future, but their use may not be relevant or appropriate in all situations.\n\nEvaluate how using genai or learning about genai fits with a course\u2019s goals and objectives.\n\nConsider whether\nor not the use of genai:\n\n-  aligns with the learning outcomes and objectives of the course;\n\n-  provides multiple means of engagement, representation, action or expression of learning;\n\n-  ameliorates differences in students\u2019 language or preparatory experiences;\n\n-  facilitates process, practice, or develops durable critical thinking skills;\n\n-  prepares students for future employment and equips them with digital and information\nliteracies; and/or\n\n-  makes the learning experience more interactive, personalized, or stimulating.\n\n**Academic Integrity:** The University of Arizona Code of Academic Integrity prohibits \u201call forms of\nacademic dishonesty, including...cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, and plagiarism.\u201d\nDefinitions of \u201ccheating\u201d vary.\n\nTherefore, students need guidelines and explanations from you about\nwhat counts as \u201ccheating\u201d or \u201cplagiarism\u201d within the context of a specific course or assignment.\n\nStudents may not be aware that genai policies can and will vary between courses, sections, instructors,\nand departments, so take time to support them in understanding and abiding by different policies.\n\nWhen introducing assignments, clearly articulate the expectations and/or boundaries of when, where,\nand how genai might be used\u2014and, if used, how it will be documented.\n\n(See guidance on\ncitation/acknowledgment in section III below.)\n\nIn considering academic integrity in your course, also\nthink about ways to foster honest behavior and if you can prevent or detect cheating.\n\nNote that\ngenai-detecting tools _are not_ reliably accurate.\n\nThe University Center for Assessment, Teaching, and\nTechnology can help you to review and re-think course assessment plans and assignments, and\nstrategize how to promote and protect academic integrity.\n\n**Accessibility, Equity, Risks, and Ethics:** Specific students are likely to be more familiar with generative\ngenai tools.\n\nAccording to a May 2023 Pew Research Study , Americans with higher household incomes and\nformal education were more likely to know about ChatGPT, and White adults who have heard of\nChatGPT are consistently less likely than their Asian, Hispanic or Black counterparts to have used the\nchatbot for fun, work or education.\n\nSome people see this technology as a way to mend inequities.\n\nAt\nthe moment many genai tools are free, but more powerful versions of these tools are starting\nto charge a subscription fee.\n\nThere are risks and practical precautions to keep in mind and discuss with\nyour students: The companies that own these tools collect information, so you and your students\nshould not enter confidential information.\n\nReview the privacy policies of any tool you use or suggest as\nclass material.\n\nLarge language models are trained on information from the internet, so their output\ncontains misconceptions, biases, violence, racism, sexism, etc.\n\nthat exist in that data.\n\nThe use of\nintellectual property by large language models is debated; lawsuits about infringement on intellectual\nproperty rights are pending.\n\ngenai makes up (hallucinates) information that is non-existent but\nsounds plausible.\n\ngenai can be steered by the bias of human-written prompts, too.\n\nGenerative\ngenai tools are not search engines; the output needs to be checked.\n\nNot all genai tools meet the\nrequirements for accessibility as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\ngenai companies have\nbeen criticized for unfair labor practices.\n\n**genai-augmented Teaching** : genai can be used to design a course, create lesson plans, write\nmultiple-choice questions, prepare a slide presentation or other course materials, and assist with\nresponding to student work Consider how you will acknowledge your use of genai tools\n\n\n-----\n\n**Instructor Workload:** Whatever your policy decision is, workload may increase.\n\nThis includes, but is not\nlimited to, creating a thoughtful syllabus policy; adjusting or adapting instruction, coursework, and\nassessments, and addressing students\u2019 questions about allowable genai use.\n\nIt may be more\ntime-consuming to disallow the use of genai in courses, especially large sections.\n\ngenai-detection\ntools are not reliable and the necessary evaluation by a human reader takes time.\n\nSo, too, do\ndiscussions with students and documentation of violations.", "genai-detection\ntools are not reliable and the necessary evaluation by a human reader takes time.\n\nSo, too, do\ndiscussions with students and documentation of violations.\n\nConsult

Syllabus Statements\n\nWhether or not instructors permit or discourage the use of genai technologies in courses, all\ncourses should include at least a syllabus statement, ideally with additional discussion, that explains the\nreasons for the course policy regarding genai use.\n\nYour reasons might include achievement of\nthe learning objectives, developing professional skills and literacies,

foundational models that can create writing,\ncomputer code, and /or images using minimal human prompting, are proliferating and becoming\nubiquitous.\n\nThis includes not only GPT-4 (and its siblings ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot), but many\nwriting assistants that are built on this or similar genai technologies.\n\nThere are now hundreds of these\nsystems that are readily available.\n\ngenai assistants are becoming more proficient at:\n\n-  Creating an outline for a paper, or bullet points and graphics for slides.\n\n-  Writing longer coherent prose in multiple languages.\n\n-  Critiquing a written passage, editing text, and correcting computer code.\n\n-  Providing explanations or ideas for a literature review with mostly accurate citations.\n\n-  Summarizing longer articles, text, or a corpus of texts.\n\n-  Suggesting a response to a question, such as on a short answer or multiple-choice test, or for a\ndiscussion board posting.\n\n-  Translating text more accurately.\n\n-  Creating computer code in multiple languages.\n\n-  Assisting users with formulas inside applications such as Excel.\n\nThese are only a few examples.\n\nMany genai applications give the user a choice of templates\n(e.g., email, essay, memo, plan) and a choice of tone to tailor the generated text to the user\u2019s need.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with the type of functionality these systems offer and\nto have a conversation with your class about these technologies, in addition to including language about\nthese technologies on your syllabus .\n\nYou may also find the genai in the Classroom FAQ helpful\nwhich contains up to date information on use of the technology.\n\nWe recognize that some instructors may want to allow, or even encourage, their students to use these\ntechnologies, and others may want to curtail their use.\n\nThe following suggested statements are intended\nto help you shape the message you provide to your students on a course

student trying to use a GenAI system to formulate the substantive claim\u2014\nwith accompanying reasoning and evidence\u2014that is being structured in written form).\n\nTransparent: Faculty and GE instructors have flexibility in how they approach newly available\nGenAI tools, and this means students will shift among a variety of approaches in their different\ncourses.\n\nIt is therefore essential for instructors to prioritize transparency so that students know\nclearly the GenAI policy in each individual class and the expectations for specific course activities\nand assignments,
